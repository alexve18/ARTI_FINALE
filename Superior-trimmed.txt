Into:
 Nah, what you get outta, outta not writing your stuff down on paper, you get the more-you know the...expression, the feeling yourself. You know what you want to say; instead of reading a paper that sounds read, it sounds narrated. Unless you wanna do it narrated... What if a dream was reality and reality was a dream?
And as complicated as it seems, if things we imagined actually happened?
And real life situations was artificial
They say we only live finna die
Imagine if we're already dead, waiting to live, living in hell
Trying to cross over to heaven we're confusing ourselves
Planet earth's like Oceans 11, we're plottin' for the getaway When my childhood friends get sent away to prison on their first offense
It's fucked up but listen, we study God but don't know him
Criticize people that work on Sundays, two jobs just to feed their kids
Well, momma's scratching lottery tickets knowing that it's just a fairy tale
Cus' we ain't gonna win
Every time that she's bubblin' in, it feels like the devil's holding a pen

Don't mind me I'm just thinking again
Thinking out loud, thinking the opposite of proud
Cus' I'm disappointed at my self sometimes
Self-esteem gets lower than night strippers
Hard to write the right rhymes, inspired by true crimes
It's not a game, it's nothing to play with
Turn it off then come back the next day, it's here to stay
Show what it is
I'm so infatuated with knowing something that's waiting after this life
That means what I'm thinking is right
Punch, loop the beat for a minute
Moment of silence for J. Dilla, he on his way home
Know he see me spillin' my heart, hope for it soon
Wait a minute [K. Dot!) you said turn it back on, bring it back
If dreams was reality
If it was cool for you to be a casualty
The only way you can escape poverty
Say that I'm weird but obviously you didn't get it when I said it the first time
You're listening too far if you hear this part
I suggest you go back and press rewind
I fast forward to common thrust of a human
Deep in my thoughts like Patrick Ewing in the paint
Look what I brought to my state that they can't bring - the industry need a fix
Stick heroin needles inside politics, this is crack music
O-pi-um, inside the veins of them, I don't abuse it
Capture each moment like film, photo-shooting all my enemies moving
Direct them to a casket
Give it to 'em only if they ask for it, if they want...
If they wanna see reality 
I'm losing you again ain't I?
Ain't I, the perfect candidate to represent the fifty states?
Black President, they don't wanna see that
It's evident...pain is pain
We only love to hate each other that's striving for great-ness
I swear to God that we live in a Matrix
Take that blue pill then we start seeing spaceships
Kanye, west-coast niggas do it the best
Bring each other down, crab in a bucket of fit
We learn to live with it I guess
I mean dive with it, since we're already dead
Trying to cross over to heaven, that's what I said the first time
Get it? Now little boy I gotta sit you down
Teach you about the things that we live around
Materialistic things that we buyin' now means nothing later when the dream kick in
Fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out... When the dreams was reality and money was love
What would we do for a buzz to maintain our sanity
Chasing the wind, striving after this vanity
Traveling, no direction, the aim is casualty
American dream or Scarface fantasy
Kilos of coke and the arms of black families
We use to it, our hearts draped in stone
A mother's dreams for her baby boy to come back soon
Cus' he out pushin' that chrome, pursuing that cash
End another niggas dreams when the fo-fifth blast
Now another mother screams picking out his casket
Harsh reality, it seems like it's simple mathematics, it's not
It's trigonometry  divided by some real life
And he'll do it again just to get a mill' twice
The streets mowed him, can't make past that
It's not a dream it's reality, look where it's at 
What happened in Manhattan happens all the time
In the hood, conspiracy to cover up crime
No nickel and dime, one shot pettiness
I wrote it in my mind as a letter to the president
World trade happened on the world stage
Same stage look at us as some educated apes
On video stations women gyrating
Parading around, mind-raping the youth
Fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out... What if a dream was reality and reality was a dream?
And as complicated as it seems, if things we imagined actually happened?
And real life situations was artificial
They say we only live finna die
Imagine if we're already dead, waiting to live, living in hell
Trying to cross over to heaven we're confusing ourselves
Planet earth's like Oceans 11, we're plottin' for the getawayFor those who don't know just what to do
Here's the Bible of love for you
Let it be a blessing every day
Every step of the way
You don't have to be in fear of rejection
Know that it's only God's direction
No matter the religion or your faith
It's the Bible of love
Bible of love, Bible of love
Till the haters get the message
Bible of love, Bible of love, Bible of Love
If you was in a pine box 
I would surely break the lock
I'd jump right in an-and fall asleep 
'Cau-'cau-'cause you are the death of me 
If you was in a pine box 
I would surely break the lock
I'd jump right in and fall asleep 
'Cau-'cau-'cause you are the death of me
'Cause you are, the-the death of me, you-you, the death of me Lookin' in the mirror, I'm embarrassed
I'm feelin' like a suicidal terrorist
React like an infant whenever you are mentioned
Mind over matter never worked for my nemesis
I'm in the matter of man arm wrestlin' hands I was dealt
When I said the music business was all I needed
When I got it I was greeted by an alien
That said last year that she slept with a Canadian
That gave him an addiction that'd keep him in Mercedes Benz
Bright lights and Rihanna as a lady friend
My vice is similar, women love when you're my type
And you're winnin' from everything that your palm write
Put her in the Palms Hotel, sin city
Devil in a dress, Platinum Chanel, live the ambiance all
'Cause the audience one day said I would do it
So instead of a verse bein' read
I'ma go and get some head off the strength of my music
I tell a bad bitch yo' ass too fat, Capitalize That
And your weave look good with the Indian tracks
Trackin' device on your used 5 series
I don't call back, just blame it on your Canadian
The same day we say were in the area cruisin' in Toronto
Hit me on the cellular thought he was gonna sell me
A false word like the rappers I know
Sat down with a few drinks, located where you can't see us
A white waitress on standby when we need her
A black Maybach, 40 pulled up Jeep
No doors, all that nigga was missin' was Aaliyah
Felt like the initiation, a reality livin' in the matrix
We talk casually about the industry
And how the women be the taste makers for the shit we makin'
Then he said that he was the same age as… myself
And it didn't help 'cause it made me even more rude and impatient
So blame it on Mr. OVOXO
The reason why I'm breathin' all the vanity I know
The reason why my best friend said she love me more than life
But I live a double life and need to let her go
The reason why the highlight was when he said:
You belong to the people when you're outside
So dig a shovel full of money, full of power, full of pussy
Full of fame and bury yourself alive, then I died
Uhh, dry as the fuck, and I'm  one left with yo-yo
Seven houses down, black street, dark  folk don't matter tho'
I don't know who to trust, what to look fo'
How many niggas wanna kill me?
I'm havin a, hard time tryin to determine
If that's the homey, or the enemy
Ol' shady-ass, no build for that
Just lookin like he plottin on somethin-ass nigga
But I wanted to mack like he fin' to do somethin
And I'll get to be dumpin on yo' ass nigga
One of the main rules, of the game, without a doubt
Nigga don't you ever pull a gun and don't use it
Nigga that's a good way to get your brains blow out
Motherfucker like me get to flashin then I lose it
Leave that ol' shit up to me and watch me prove it
Nigga, you betta be real about this shit
If you in it you in it don't be no punk
Nigga this ain't no baseball game, niggas don't FORFEIT NO DAMN FUNK Two brothers goin sack for sack
In the back of the 'llac, takin a whiffle
Strippin the fuck up out of some willow
Poppin ecstasy like Skittles
It'll get you in the long run, sniffin them long ones
Way girl burst ya dick and now it got ya on one
Came up shorted, circumstances nigga quote it
What goes around comes around tryin to steal this  Brady hostess
Keep your focus, and never the love of the hocus pocus
Set up hoes lovin to get jackers to come and smoke us
Die-hard soldier, T-Pup-alicious, cops get vicious
No mercy on haters or no bitches
Got in my clitches waitin for a nigga to take some chances
So we can deal with these hardco' Sic-Wid-It-ass circumstances Takin all these CHANCES
You might never ever ever get them CIRCUMSTANCES
Penitentiary CHANCES
You might never ever ever get them CIRCUMSTANCES I said the world is full of crack babies
I remember when the world went crazy
Til I copped a sack, and put it down like that
And rolled out like it didn't even fade me Nigga - slang suga delight enough to get my hustle right
It's double like, a flip new Benzo with the bubble lights
Scuffle fights with rats and roaches, I was the brokest
Motherfucker, now I'm the closest nigga to ballin ferocious
Motherfucker, dust a nigga off like wax off, cracks off a hard
 Pimpin ain't easy and motherfucker only if you breezy
Easy does it, I does it do it off the fluid
Come with the newest shit I come through with
Bitch don't you hear the music?

Too sexy for my shirt so bad hurt
Niggas on the turf wanna put my ass up in the dirt, cause I skirt
A Lex-o and slurp a genie bottle full of X-O
Or maybe cause I'm with 40-Water and a jug of ethel
You can't love it, don't leave the ghetto
Me and I'm heated like two jugs of methyl Damn, cydal shit when vital shit starts to happen
Eager to be the nigga just for cappin
Strappin up ain't no thang, it's survival
It's makin sure you all good when it comes to enemies and rivals
It's +Higher Learning+, but it's +True Lies+
When it comes to the +Superfly+
Speedy Gonzalez destroyes from the Eastside
Is it ridicule or stardom? Did we hurt yo' feelings, pardon
I'm makin niggas fall like cops on +Rage in Harlem+
 I'm on some moonshine shit
Bit the cork off the Cristal
I'm drunk so let me chill for a while Aww yeah yeah now niggas know
Well ain't no sense in me fuckin around
My stompin ground be the H-I-double-L-S-I-D-E bound
To touch you with them tecs and make them marks, bounce like checks
Slide a faulty bitch up under these niggas
And killin 'em off with sex
Ain't no tellin what angle I'm comin with these circumstances
Penitentiary chances, nina ruff fluffin tap dancers
On your hood for breedin snitch bitch-made niggas
Don't fade triggers so they quick get sprayed niggas
I fuck with wig-splitters, Colombian neck-tie throat slitters
 take a long time business to get paid
To get rid of you cheater
Chatter police-ass niggas takin chances 
Man you can't fuck with these circumstances And all you O.G. motherfuckers better stop tryin to mark them yungsta
Cause sooner or later, they gon' dump, like some garbage dusters
Tryin to throw yo' weight around
Like you gon', uhh, take over a spot
Nigga don't you know these youngsters nowadays
Be off that water and hot? 
I keep it fresher than the next bitch
No need..for you to ever sweat the next bitch
..with speed, I make the best bitch see the exit..indeed
You gotta know your thoroughly respected by me
You get the keys to the Lexus, with no driver
You gotcha own '96 suh-in..the ride
And keep your ass tighter than Versace thats why
You gotta watch your friends you got to watch me
They conniving shit
The first chance to crack the bank
They try me, all they get is 50 cent franks
And papayas, from the village to the tele
Time to kill it on your belly no question
I got more black chicks between my sheets than Essence
They say sex is a weapon, so when I shoot
Mmet your death in less than 8 seconds
Still poundin in my after life..
Laugin my shit is tight
You who askin right... Ain't no nigga like the one I got
No one can fuck you betta
Sleeps around but he gives me alot
Keeps you in diamonds and leathers
Friends 'ill tell me I should leave you alone
Hah hah, hah hah, hah hah, hah ha
Tell the freaks to find a man of there own
 Fresh to def in Moschino, coach bag

Surrouding your feet in Joanie Dega's and Charles Jordan
I keep ya dove but love
You know these ho's be makin me weak

Fuck them Reebok broads, you made it known who your wife was

Get your baby kidnapped and your baby-mother fucked
It's Tha Carter 3, bitch, better put your supper up
Hollygrove, I throw it up like I'm trying to lose my gut
Fuck is up? Beat him up like a million uppercuts
Got a million duffled up for the fuck of it, shit
Get on my level, you can't get on my level
You gon' need a space shuttle or a ladder that's forever
However, I'm better, if not now, then never
Don't you ever fix your lips unless you 'bout to suck my dick
Bitch, swallow my words, taste my thoughts
And if it's too nasty, spit it back at me
Two more inches, I'd have been in that casket
According to the doctor, I could've died in traffic
Bounce right back on them bitches, like Magic
Abracadabra, I'm up, like Viagra
I just do this shit for my clique, like Adam Sandler
I control hip-hop and I'mma keep it on my channel

And sure enough, I got Miss Cita in a better place
When I was 14, I told my mom we will see better days

Everything you say and everything you do gets me lost in you days at a time
Tell me are you feeling me, feeling you... 2 Chaaaiinzz In the a.m. I think about her fragrance

Not what she say... but what she bank
And how she think... I can't complain
On to the next one pro-gression
Keep the past and the present, separate
I got alotta spots like a leopard
One to trap in, one to have sex in
One to stack in, one to get dressed in
I'm getting married Ben Franklin my best man

Blowing green that's keeping us going
Unconditional love showing
Yo, yo, yo, yo
40th side, 41st side ride Me and my Dunns come from the slums
You can't take the slums out my Dunns
And that's how it is, that's how we live
Sometimes I find myself wearing the same shit for days
Not caring, bout what they gon' think or say
I got that, I don't give a fuck in me, it's stuck in me
That's how I 'vantage over y'all niggas, y'all too pretty
We too gritty, like Sanford and Son
Too grimy like Pigpen with jewels on
See we the top rap niggas, the Q-Dogs
You got a lot of nerve, putting out them songs
Knowing that my niggas come strong, so let's get it on
We just getting warm, operation Quiet Storm
Silent wars or we silence the fours
Hav, P, and Nas, got it in the smash, fo'sho
Now it's movies and soundtracks
This is where your career stop at Ayo, I drink to that
I'm like a dictionary, y'all rappers exam me
You violate, they read your obituary in front your family
You should idolize Nas in the flesh
Don't wait 'til I'm dead, to say I was the best, no doubt
We shot hoops with coat hangers, got loot with dope slangers
Sold soap to strangers, joked with danger
Rob prostitutes, dodge cops in hot pursuit
Bought weight from rastas, travel hot routes
O.T. commute back and forth
Tell shorty get that package off
Fuck being trapped up North, being told where to eat and shit
Caught a case then I beat the shit
D's on the block flash badges, nylon jackets
Big white boys with guns yelling, Freeze black kids!
Got my niggas in the pen, eating octopus
Wishing they was on the blocks with us
To watch me and P do it 
Put it out, first day, the whole street knew it
Bitches, hold they pussies and bop to the music
And think deep to it, now who the truest? Yo..

Blowing green that's keeping us going
Unconditional love showing
Yo you fam to me, and only fam to me
That can get that close to me, keep it type strong Dirty fingernails, reaching in my pocket pulling knots out
I daydream of better days, in different ways
Out this lifestyle we live, iced-out with the big fifth
That's why the burnt leather lean to the left
Even though we gained cash on fish
I'm trapped on reason being we ain't all rich
And I'ma be that same nigga for the door
And I'ma still walk the same path, we soon clash
We get stacks, you do the math
We pound niggas out, walk away and laugh
Fresh from out the lab, P and Nastradamus, kid
Rap niggas shit they drawers Yo they probably did
I aircondition y'all niggas, my prediction is you rewind this
Your highness, Q-Boro's finest
Click your Timbs three times, the wizard is Nas
Grant you a wish, you get rich while listening hard
To my thugs in the prison yard, bench-pressing 200 pounds and up
Feeling like you down on your luck
Raise up, I feel your pain, hit the law library
Appeal the game, all eyes on me
Restrained from, being looked at, it's uncivilized
We epitomize thug song, y'all niggas get mad
Jealous rappers is puss, ain't got no style
No heart and no look, shook
Get stole on, my niggas move right in the moonlight
Y'all niggas get done, I pee on them son, they a small issue
We too official, blue steel pistols
Teflon vests, it's no contest, we hit you Dunn you fam to me, and only family
That can get that close to me, keep it type strong
Blowing green that's keeping us going
Unconditional love showing
Yo, yo, yo, yo
40th side, 41st side ride Yeah, youknahmsayin'
Not for nothing baby
Knahmsayin' wanna give a shout out to my peoples
YouknowhatImean, Yambo, Ill Will
Killa Black, my brother
It's never gonna be another, word up..
Yeah, you know how we do dunn, word up The future is nothing but a series of probability made up of decisions that we make right now but these decisions leads to certain events into the future and every human being has a capability to determine their own future
Some are just more into it than others... Yeah, see I know I can make a lot of money doing this man
It's just the whole process that uh...
That I'm having trouble with know what I mean
I know you just pretty much, you know
Get the water boiling and just uh get a jar or something like that
Put it in the jar and just watch it you know bubble up and all that Shame on him! 
Lemme put my gloves on
And my scrubs on
I'm the chemist that's whippin' it in the kitchen
This here is not for the children
You need parental advision
If you wanna learn how to cook in the dope business
First you bargain shop
Look for the priciest chickens
I recommend that you pay
Jorge a visit
Got it wrapped in saran
17.5 no
Drop four grand
This is LA man
Unless it be a drought
But homie if it ain't
Then it is somewhere else
Flip your hustle down south
That's a whole other story though
Back to the lesson
Hope you're takin' down your footnotes
Class is in session
Get your instruments
Grab some baking soda, a triple beam, a beaker
And a hanger you can stir it with
Split nine Os four ways in that 36
Place it on the triple beam
As hard as it may seem, it's not that tricky
Say you'll get it baby just bear with me
Confidence before compliments
Now let's get busy
This is the procedure
250 grams of coke, 150 grams of soda
Place it in the beaker
Your water should be boiling by then
Grab a small cup and pour it in
Twist the hanger until it's paper thin
Place the hanger in the beaker then give your wrist a circular spin
But hold on it gets tricky again!
As your hand rotate
You're probably thinkin' it's safe
Until it starts to harden, slowing down the pace
The muscle inside your arm is makin' your joints ache
You're strugglin' on the job, but don't lose faith
Wait...you got it back soft 
Now pour some hot water inside the beaker jar
The work should rise to the top
Then pour some cold water on that
That's when the dope should drop
Snatch the cookie out the jar, grab a razor from the cabinet
Place it on the cardboard, then chop
As soon as the razor hit the work, you're happy
You're excited that the chemistry worked
This the fiend's appetite
This bigger than life
You turned to Mr. Nino Brown in one night
You should thank me twice
Though you learned from a chemist who never moved a brick in his life
How ironic...hmm
Like most of you rappers Aw I don't believe that man
You're too professional with it man
There's no way you've never done it before, know what I mean
That was too descriptive
Baby got the club on lock
V.I.P. with the bottles getting popped
That's what I like to see 
Go lil mama go, go, go, go, go 
Go lil mama go
Shawty got it all turnt up
Rocking with her girls looking good as fuck
That's what I like to see 
Go lil mama go, go, go, go, go 
Go lil mama go Ooh!
She running her phone so she got the building on lock
The other girls mad because she bad and they not
I'm on her I'm at her I'm on the case immediately
Try'na do some things you can see on regular TV
Parental guidance rated X, not rated PG
Take her to the double tree and spread her legs like a V-neck
A couple of hours after we meet
She had a tattoo on her coochie that read 'slippery when wet'
I left a good taste in her mouth after I head
Sat on the edge on the couch and smoked a spliff
Felt hella guilty after I played her my bitch
But at least it was worth it mane, her coochie was the shit She got it
Lil mama got the club on lock, look
Cameras follow her through the club she photogenic
Them bitches rocking knock-offs but her bag authentic
Club lock I unlock it the crowd shift
The blood pre-roll yack guzzle I read lips
She want a nigga with Rocky Mountains like Colorado
Girl sexy as fuck the seven in the Tahoe
Hard-hitter I teach em how to reverse count
Club smashed street niggas with larger mouths
She allergic to lames she wanna P
And all my P partners know the terminology
Look, operation pull that ass over black and white
Gas bitches I'm on a petal, like a bike
Yeah, yeah She got the club on lock
Her booty pop pass so her natural and organic
The thickest broad I ever seen the biggest butt on the planet
I'm try'na stick it and ram it I wanna plug it and jam it
A whole lot to handle but I think I can handle it
She go to work every day, she got her own cake
After the perfect push-up, she get me off like a shake way
Go to City College, all about her cash
Every Tuesday and Thursday she teach a pole-dancing class
She got game, she from Cali
All the ballers wanna be her baby daddy
She ain't shame, she a freak
She fucking up the leather on my seats
Beatch! 
His eyes bloodshot red
I watched him as he took a fifth of Henny to the head in memory of his brother
Reminiscing on them playing Sega with each other
He was hurting, I can see it, plenty tears, no kleenex
I stood by his side because that was my homie
Gave him a hug, some of his brother's blood got on me
Clinching his fist on some angry shit
Stood up, sat back down on the curb and asked me who they be hangin' with
I wasn't sure so I gave him no answer
But I was sure that he had him a blammer and wanted war
Revenge, what do you say to a good friend
That just lost it and grabbin' choppers out of the closet
I tried my best to make him renig
But he was like, my nig this feeling is more than personal
I stood down
He hopped in a four door, Honda Accord before he
Bent the block, he said K Dot 
These streets can turn a kid to killer in minutes
Not by choice, but forced to be a menace
Can someone just pray for me, or war
 the city pressure
The AK-47, twin MAC-11s
The Desert Eagle, shotty and the Smith & Wessons
Pray for me, or war Corners become monuments for the dead
Candles on the pavement, postcard read
Rest in peace, the yellow tape blockin' off the streets
A baby mama yellin at the police
But you don't understand
You figure that we're just a bunch of niggas but the picture here's a story untold
Y' see this wasn't in our plans
Babies from the late 80s wasn't born crazy, we was raised that way
Put that Malcom X book down then raise that K
Complete chaos when we off x pills and St. Ides
Look the devil in the face, from a sane eye
Cast the spell on you like Akeelah and the Bee
Every killer in the street is a teen with a corrupted, mind
Substance, time, is no longer an issue
We don't have it, so pass the tissue
Then close the casket, kiss the momma when you can
And tell her you understand, but you don't understand He came back fifteen minutes later
He said, Dot, I went on one, do me this favor
Dump these guns in a safe place, let nobody see you
This as critical as it gets, my nigga I need you
I said alright, so what happened? Seen a few niggas slippin
And I just started clappin, I didn't care who I was hittin
That's wild shit, but anyway I got you
I love you nigga make sure you hit me up by tomorrow
I woke up the next mornin' with a cold
Allergies got me sneezin and wipin' my nose when it was leaking
Checked the medicine cabinet, lookin for some Dayquil
But all I seen was some Asprin, just my luck
I got up, went to Rite Aid
Hoping that the pharmacy department had the right aid - I bought it and left
Walked to the parking lot, when I see the faces of death
Said they was lookin for my man with a chopper in they hand
Prayin it would jam, but you don't understand Its like a revolving door that i've been a part of my whole life. fucked up right?
Same shit everyday, everyday
Come to the club
Stand on the couch, act a fool like fuck it
Tell the waitress hurry up though 
Cause I'm trynna get drunk right now in this bitch like fuck it

As one  

I don't know why, I.. get so high oh

Get so high oh, get so high, high off the life The allure of breaking the law
Was always too much for me to ever ignore
I've got a thing for the big-body Benzes, it dulls my senses
In love with a V-Dub engine
Man, I'm high off life, fuck it, I'm wasted
Bathing Ape kicks, Audemars Piguet wrist
My women-friends get tennis bracelets
Trips to Venice, get their Winters replaced with
The sun...it ain't even fun no more, I'm jaded
Man, it's just a game, I just play it to play it
I put my feet in the footprints left to me
Without saying a word, the ghetto's got a mental telepathy
My brother hustled so, naturally
Up next was me, but what perplexes me
Shit, I know how this movie ends, still I play
The starring role in Hovito's Way It's just life, I solemnly swear
To change my approach, stop shaving coke
Stay away from hoes, put down the toast
'Cause I be doing the most 
But every time I felt That was that, it called me right back
It called me right back
Man, it called me right back  I'm like a Russian mobster, drinking distilled vodka
Until I'm under the field with Hoffa, it's real
Peel the top up like a toupée, mix the water with the soda
Turn the pot up, make a soufflé
All of y'all can get it like group-page on your 2-way
I'm living proof that crime do pay
Say hooray to the bad guy, and all the broads
Putting cars in their name, for the stars of the game
Putting 'caine in their bras and their tomorrows on the train:
All in the name of love
Just to see that love locked in chains and the family came
Over the house to take back everything that they claimed
Or even the worse pain is the distress
Learning you're the mistress only after that love gets slain
And the anger and the sorrow mixed up leads to mistrust
Now it gets tough to ever love again
But the allure of the game, keeps calling your name
To all the Lauras of the world, I feel your pain
To all the Christies in different cities and Tiffany Lanes:
We all hustlers in love with the same thing It's just life, I solemnly swear
To change my approach, stop shaving coke
Stay away from hoes, put down the toast
'Cause I be doing the most 
But every time I felt That was that, it called me right back
It called me right back
Man, it called me right back  I never felt more alive than riding shotgun
In Klein's green 5, until the cops pulled guns
And I tried to smoke weed to give me the fix I need -
What the game did to my pulse - with no results
And you can treat your nose and still won't come close
The game is a light bulb with eleventy-million volts
And I'm just a moth addicted to the floss
The doors lift from the floor and the tops come off
By any means necessary, whatever the cost
Even if it means lives is lost
And I can't explain why I just love to get high
Drink, life! smoke the blueberry sky, blink twice
I'm in the blueberry 5, you blink three times
I may not even be alive
I mean even James Dean couldn't escape the allure
Dying young, leaving a good-looking corpse, of course It's just life, I solemnly swear
To change my approach, stop shaving coke
Stay away from hoes, put down the toast
'Cause I be doing the most 
But every time I felt That was that, it called me right back
It called me right back
Man, it called me right back  Once again its the life
Yeah I said its the life
Once I again its the life
(OH NO! I don't know why, I...
Get so high oh
Get so high oh
Get so high, high off the life)
Yeah on the real to be honest witchu

And send money to my G's in the penitentiaries
See it's niggas like that that I need
So when you hear my name in jail you better speaks well
Cause you never know which one of my homies is in the cell
The beach do it swell, so check out how I feel You gotta be off the wall to represent this

Like she tired of Mickey-D's, Wendy's, Denny's
Like she tired of Macy's, JC Penney's
I got bitches gettin' tired of spendin', spend it
If we winnin', win it
I know dreamchasers that ain't never dreamt it
So I had to tint it and I had to rim it
And I worked the lanes like Shaq and Penny
It's the Blood gang, it's the money gang
Red rags to riches, need happy endings
Then it's back to bidness, and we laugh at sentencin'
Hungry lawyers make a snack out witnesses
Hungry artists or starvin' artists
In the kitchen, restaurant, and cafeterias
Don't make a difference if you taste the difference
Better pay the difference to the racketeers
Now your good luck lookin' like you crackin' mirrors
Now the artificial become sacrificial
That's a body count, where the mathematician?
Where the wettest clitoris and fattest nipples
With an ass that jiggle with a grab or tickle
With a throat deep enough to land a missile?
If your nigga miss you and he have opinions
Tell him two cents is only half a nickel
Now we at his villa aiming at his pillows
Hair triggers, fingers finna act like bristles
And I catch a triple, flip, kick, jiu-jitsu
Throwin' pool parties, she don't have a swimsuit
Neither of her friends do, I think that's official
Got my neighbor's eyes bigger than the Simpsons
And her man is simple so I had to pimp her
And she had potential but he lacked credentials
So give me a sec', I'll go at your neck
And send you back lookin' like the Dracula bit you, rrr!
Yeah, cannibalism, goin' animalistic in a land of civilians
These niggas clones, copycats, and chameleons
Once they dead and gone, no paraphernalia
When she left her thong, that's paraphernalia
Sound familiar? My plug's Sicilian
He the one who told me that sometimes
You gotta leave your la familia behind the millions
Rhyme or reason, I'm the reason
Got their eyes wide but too blind to see it
With friends like those
It make me text all my enemies and tell 'em I don't need 'em
Hallelujah, power intruders
Bitch walk around my house like Hooters
Towel user, power user
Molly mixed with white girl, Molly/Susan
Niggas talkin' out their bowel movers
Turn their homies into flower choosers
Turn your kids into father choosers
Make your bitch a widow and your mom a cougar
I'm a silent shooter with a silent shooter
Clap at you, if you don't die, I'll boo ya
Tell a doc that's tryna save your life
And runnin' wires through you, he could die next to ya, rrr!
I'ma make the nurse ride me like a giant scooter
Let her partner shoot it, we put out the movie
Win awards, she got a Golden Globe head and an Oscar booty
Niggas prostitutin'
These rappers ain't talkin' 'bout shit, not even 'bout pollution
Ain't got a house to live in, ain't got a pool to swim in
Change in their pockets, nor a couch to lose it
En route to Houston with a contribution
Full of Monster juices, Mazda too slow
Macho, Cujo, macho mucho
Big bad wolf, watch the moon glow, rrr!
I got a Greek freak, she call me Antetokounmpo
Just follow the coupe, ho, and I know that you know
I'm hotter than soup, she still swallow my soup bowl
I'm out of my loophole, you out of the loop though
Got all these niggas on silent and mute mode
The power to do so, my pockets is sumo
Gettin' the mula by the minuto
Mafia Nouveau, I am the uno
Real boss nigga, should model for Hugo
Fuck with me, I go Lolapaloozo
Pull up, trigger finger, holler, and pull-o
Pow-pow-pow, sound like a symphony, or opera, two-door
Hittin' some new notes
And I am the maestro, and you just a typo
Private flight, don't fly in too low
I'm wiser than you know, a private school flow
I got me a new ho, and now it's a duo
One went to college and one went to ju-co
I had to ask 'em, what's four plus two though? Rrr! My ultimate basketball dream team
The starting five would most likely be umm
Of course I'ma have to start with Kobe Bryant, umm
This gone take a minute, umm, Chris Paul
Uhh, Shaquille O'Neal, LeBron James
And umm, oh you know I'm gon say Steph Curry, hehe, Steph Curry
You already know that's my starting five, I got money on them
Holla at ya boy
I told you from the jump, me and you just friends
Never did date cause I knew that shit would end
Made you upset when I told you how it is
Now we don't talk, but ever since then
You been worrying about a nigga, and you calling my phone
Looking for info through my songs
Accusing me of shit, girl you know that's wrong
Trust me when I say, that we better off alone
Know you hate it cause you want someone else
You really shouldn't focus on me
You need to worry 'bout someone else
And as you can see, I've been doing my own thing, 
I'm trying to make this move
You're a diamond under pressure
But you always kept it cool
And I told you play your role
You know you just decide
You say that you want to leave
But don't know how to decide
But I know you want to stay
You ain't going to find nobody realer
You caught feelings like a nigga was a picture Told you from the jump, don't catch no feelings
I told you, you would get hurt, in the ending
 don't catch no feelings
Don't catch no feelings Dammit, dammit darling I gave you warnings
And I needed space like a fucking martian
moreover, super sober
I needed room as if I was Marvin
Slow but surely
Darwin's theory
Hearts revealing an eerie feeling
As time gets even, never place queries on me
You yapped too much about the penny ante
This mechanic is so uncanny
Trying to grind a Grammy up for ya mammy
Implode a plan up then expand it
Things grow, wonderful
Dreams become your growth
Forever under oath
Rollie gold 'til i overdose
Girl, you know you was throwed the most 
Well, Ex X'd Tisk Tisk
Fly to shit around a lit wrist
Nigga that, Bitch this
Oh well, you're dismissed!
Like school-bells & Dipshits
The truth was never distorted
No strings attached, we were cordless
It's important to be smart and gorgeous Told you from the jump, don't catch no feelings
I told you, you would get hurt, in the ending
 don't catch no feelings
Don't catch no feelings
Told you from the jump, don't catch no feelings
I told you, you would get hurt, in the ending
Yeah, I told her, I said, don't catch no feelings
Don't catch no feelings with me girl
Uh-uh, fuck that  Eight doobies to the face, fuck that
Twelve bottles in the case, nigga, fuck that
Two pills and a half-weight, nigga, fuck that
Got a high tolerance when your age don't exist Man, I swear my nigga trippin' off that shit again
Pick him up, then I set him in cold water
Then I order someone to bring him Vicodin
I hope that take the pain away
From the feelin' that he felt today
You know, when you part of Section.80
And you feel like no one can relate
'Cause you are, you are, a loner, loner
Marijuana endorphins make you stronger, stronger
I'm in the house party, trippin' off
My generation sippin' cough syrup like it's water
Never no pancakes in the kitchen
Man, not one of our lives is caught up
In the daily superstition that the world is 'bout to end
Who gives a fuck? We never do listen
'Less it comes with a 808 
Playstation and some drank 
Lookin' around and all I see
Is a big crowd that's product of me
And they probably relatives relevant for a rebel's dream
Yep, her president is black, she black too
Purple label on her back, but that tab is light blue
She take it straight to the head
Then she look at me, she got A.D.H.D Eight doobies to the face, fuck that
Twelve bottles in the case, nigga, fuck that
Two pills and a half-weight, nigga, fuck that
Got a high tolerance when your age don't exist Like whoa-whoa, whoa, whoa-whoa

Whoa, whoa-whoa

Whoa, whoa-whoa, whoa, whoa-whoa
 And then she started…
And then she started feelin' herself
Like no one else in this apartment
Beg your pardon? Oh, I rap, baby.
How old are you?, She say 22, I say 23
Okay, then we are crack babies.
Damn, why you say that? She said, Where my drink at?
I'ma tell you later
Just tell your neighbors that the police relaxed.
I stood up, shut the blind, closed the screen; Jumbotron
Made to the back where she reside
Then she said, Read between the lines.
Yep, hope that I get close enough when the lights turn down
And the fact that she just might open up
When the Nuvo start to drown
Her body and I know
The both of us really deep in the mood now
It's nothin' we can do now
Somebody walked in with a pound of that Bay Area kush
She looked at me, then looked at it
Then she grabbed it, then she said, Get it understood.
You know why we crack babies?
Because we born in the '80s, that A.D.H.D. crazy. Eight doobies to the face, fuck that
Twelve bottles in the case, nigga, fuck that
Two pills and a half-weight, nigga, fuck that
Got a high tolerance when your age don't exist Like whoa-whoa, whoa, whoa-whoa

Whoa, whoa-whoa

Whoa, whoa-whoa, whoa, whoa-whoa
 You can have all my shine, I'll give you the light
Double cup, deuce, four, six, just mix it in Sprite
Ecstasy, 'shrooms, blow, 'dro, hoes, whatever you like
You can have all my shine, I'll give you the light 
I don't know why niggas tripping on a nigga
For clippers, I hate you niggas too
But I'm black and Mexican, we gon' change that, haha
I hate you niggas too! If you ain't had good pussy, nigga, try some
Your girl ain't got no ass, she need to buy one

Came for them bricks like I'm Maisie
We hit up the trap which is booming
Hustle, French John Newman
Fuck making the move, we the movie
Fuck the whole group, I'm a groupie
All that money rolling through the lobby
VVS is dripping off my body
You can do what you want when you got it
Go get a bitch and then build her body
They wanted Versace Milan
We do what we want and then copy
Smack a Roley on my arm
Skrrr, middle fingers to the feds
Put a hundred dollars on your head
Price of life hit you
And all my dawgs gotta eat
And all the money get divided
Snipe game be the wildest

A problem with the kid is what you never want
That's what you want, I had my niggas waiting for you
Like you sitting at a table in a restaurant
Slice you like pizza, I keep six in the squeezer
My jewelry is nice, dressing is iced
It's how you can sit in the freezer
Keep my dick in the diva, word, no problem licking it either
Baby girl could be a believer, we could just kick it like FIFA
All the women heavy like pallbearer
That Henney got that cake like Carvel
Carvel, me, I'mma die
Inside the pussy, man, I know just how Lamar felt
My bitch sit on me flat without no tummy tuck
She no stripper but all she do is pick money up
Five-o called me over, word to my homie, I ain't tell 'em shit
He seemed aggy, so all I did was tell him this If you ain't had good pussy, nigga, try some
Your girl ain't got no ass, she need to buy one

You still owe me money, nigga, yeah, yeah
Listen up, Princess I wake up in the morning
Take a knee and thank God
Then go to the mirror, look myself in the eye
Today I didn't wake up with a woman on my side
Yesterday I didn't wake up with a woman on my side
Neither the day before that, nor before that
I just remember the moments, call me Kodak
And know that I do miss ya
But it's your denial that I must hold against ya
Since you've been gone, I've been all alone
But alone is steroids, cuz it made me strong
Girl, hurr gone in the wind
You cheated on God's son
Baby girl, that's a sin
But I forgive you
But I can't give you
Another chance, ma, you're in my rear-view
And I put that ring on your finger
I was all in
But now it's just a symbol of what could've been
Goddamn And now I'm by myself, but 
Damn, she left me all by myself, but  Yo, I love my niggas; no homo
I swear I hope all get cheese like Digiorno
It's something 'bout the Hot Boyz that you don't know
I gotta love for em that I don't show
And B.G. been my nigga since the front door
I hope Chopper City Records blow
Fa sho'
And me and Juve never really got along
But you still would let yo nigga come get on yo hottest song
Damn, I fuck wit ya for that
I fuck with ya Lil Wack
And me and Skip go back 
When you see a real nigga, you gotta tip yo hat
And since I'm a real nigga, I do just that
I had my own lawyer working on Turk's case
After I heard him dissin me on the mixtape
Cause he's locked up, and I'm free
He got a lot more to worry about than me
I ain't trippin Y'all niggas left me by myself, but I can't front 
And so, now
I've become the President of the spot y'all left me at
A lot has changed, but, I can't font 
Bear witness
Watch me get it in like underage club attendants
The roof go back like it's vintage
The young boy's back to burn your village, the fire touching the ceiling burn
What's God willing when HOVA retired?
Now he back, guess he got some competition on his hands
Who is that? I...am...
K-Dot, I'm claustrophobic don't put me in the box with you niggas
You can't categorize me
I'm already convinced that I'm the hottest nigga out
Any comments? I thought so
You niggas is gassed up like ALCO
Scared to play Madden on All-Pro
Step your game up
I'm here to fuck up niggas' barcodes
SoundScan'll never read your albums again 
I take 99.9% of your fans
The last one left is your moms 
Ain't nothing gifted about you
Put a bullet in you, tell a doctor get it up out you
I'm 'bout to, send him right there, he shark food
Piranhas is coming I put beat on you rap dudes
I don't wait on you rap dudes
Nigga NASA couldn't reach my altitude
Sky's the limit, and your body ain't airborne...
Is it? Are you? My real niggas, once again it's on
'Til we load the ammo and drop the bomb
I kick up destruction and when I'm done
My city blow them horns, it sounds like...
WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOO OOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!
When they blow dem horns I'm coming
Torch in hand, yes, I'm running I told you Rock, I like red too
But you gotta kill these niggas out the blue
They don't see it coming
Who ain't a part of the family tree
Do 'em like Paul Bunyan, axe about him
We travel like an ant colony, you can't count us
Sip Henny 'til my throat drown
New Benz, No Malice
Count money 'til our hands get calloused
40 caliber in the Cavalier, welcome to Los
Angeles, you might leave with bandages
Real life, no mannequin
You pull out, no panicking, you better shoot
Or have something fall on your rooftop, no raindrops
I'm talking 'bout gold bullets and black suits
No magician, no magic, POOF
Closed casket fatal attraction
Son 3 hit you like John Paxson, I ain't bullshitting
Them veterans been loved 'em
Talk about bars I got a life sentence of 'em
And I'm just like spitting cousin, ciao
No man get the best of him The way I see, why rap?
I'm just wasting my breath
Y'all don't hear me
I'm just chasing my death
It's all over, the end's here so I'm pacing my steps
Try not to recollect what I know
These pregnant quotes meaning, they give life like semen
Be the reason my heart's bleeding
I'm coughing up blood in my palms as I recite the book of Psalms
Over a slow clap and kick drum, wis-dom
The application of your knowledge is me
Pay your tuition, this verse is like a college degree
Y'all don't hear me, y'all fear me like a doomsday prophet
When I'm focused, nothing under the moon can stop it
I leave you off the Earth's surface, that's what you get
For trying to test my patience like nurses
This ain't a verse this is a Kennedy curse
Put your brain on your lady's purses, you niggas crazy My real niggas, once again it's on
'Til we load the ammo and drop the bomb
I kick up destruction and when I'm done
My city blow them horns, it sounds like...
WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOO OOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!
When they blow dem horns I'm coming
Torch in hand, yes, I'm running
My real niggas, once again it's on
'Til we load the ammo and drop the bomb
I kick up destruction and when I'm done
My city blow them horns, it sounds like...
WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOO OOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!
When they blow dem horns I'm coming
Torch in hand, yes, I'm running

Benjamin Franklin, niggas know that I keep it 100
Got me a new clip for my .223 and that bitch hold a hundred
I'm still in the hood, I got me a check and I don't want no Nike's
Bitches, they suckin', and fuckin', they do everything except bite it
I can go slow like an old man, I can go fast like I got nitrous
Spent 20 racks for my brother's appeal and I ain't talkin' no Vicodin
Over 1 mil in this room, bitch, I kinda sound like a Pisces
Lil bitch you know I'm the bomb and 2 Chainz the light, no lightnin'

Make a little money, leave a little on the dresser
Make a little money, leave a little on the dresser Ain't nothin' special man, I sold it all yester'

Dammit man, I do not know Tar but I'm  having Xan's
My bitch pussy wet like it's wetting rain
This bitch clap on me while I clap at mans, woah
Got Balenciaga's I ain't even wore yet
Half a pound of gas I ain't smoke yet
Traphouse filled up with Ziploc

PART 2: Lil Boy Who killed little boy, who killed little boy?
Rat infested hallways, no escape, no escape
From misery, no way out from that hell I'm bout to give these niggas what they ask for
I used to have to argue with my land lord
Yea, my nickname is Tity Boi
Bitch gotta have at least a handful
All my cribs came with a damn pool
Used to stash work in my camel
Young 6'5 with the handle
If you don't watch Atlanta then you need to turn the channel
See I pull up in this bitch in a Phantom
Front grill looking like it's dancin' 
Put some stacks on your head little boy 
Yeah they 'bout to call you the grandson 
Pussy nigga gonna need a tampon 
Put rifle bullets in a handgun 
Keep a bankroll on me, nigga
By the time I eat some bacon I got bands on
All my cars I done put rims on 'em
I done touched down, no end zone
All that bitch do is run her mouth, nigga
On the right but that bitch got a Sprint phone 
Man she got about 100 acres
Enough yard for me to put a couple Benz's on
And I just pop me a perc
I might fuck that bitch with my Timbs on
 I guess you knew and blew a good thing, baby Bye baby, I guess you knew why I walked away
When we walked to the altar, that was an awesome day
Did counselling, couldn't force me to stay
Something happens when you say I do, we go astray
Why did we mess it up? We was friends, we had it all
Reason you don't trust men, that was your daddy fault
He in the grave – let it go, he no longer living
Said you caught him cheating with mom, fucking other women
Fuck that gotta do with us? Here's the keys to the newest truck
Birkin bags, we burning cash, now baby, do it up
No matter who you fuck, that was before me
Wanted you as my shorty since before I saw you screaming
Hate you so much right now
Should've saw the meaning, angry black woman
Actions of a demon, I'm leaving I guess you knew and blew a good thing, baby 
You know I'm saying bye-bye 
'Cause I'm saying bye-bye 
'Cause I'm saying bye-bye
I guess you knew and blew a good thing, baby Bye baby, I guess you know why I had to leave
Seven months in your pregnancy, 'bout to have my seed
Let's take it back some years, rewind it to the happy years
You and your Star Trak fam, I'm thinking you cats are weird
Same time, different year, I was digging y'all flow
Then I tatted you on my arm so niggas would know
I thought no one could stop us, matching gold watches
I was your Johnny Depp, you was my Janis Joplin
Yet the cuter version, yet I knew you personally
Better than you knew yourself – and I knew this for certain
Crib in the Dominican, you got away from everybody
You screaming at the racist cops in Miami was probably
The highlight of my life, like Ha, yo, look at my wife!
Gangsta, me and 20 cops 'bout to fight, crazy night
Bailed you out, next morning we got clean
Like it never happened, and later we at that Heat game
Just another day in the life of two people in love
But it wasn't enough, so baby, guess what... I guess you knew and blew a good thing, baby 
OH! OH! AHHHHHHHH! Bye-bye 
I can't believe that this is happening to us
'Cause I'm saying bye-bye 
'Cause I'm saying bye-bye
I guess you knew and blew a good thing, baby Listen, could you imagine writing your deposition
Divorce lawyer telling you how this thing gonna be ending?
With you paying out the ass and I'm talking half
Not some, but half, no, serious, half
Half of your soul, half of your heart, you leaving behind
It’s either that or die, I wanted peace of mind
And all I seen was selfish cowards
Under their breath, saying, Why did Nas trust her?
But look at yourself! Speak louder, bruh!
You live with your baby moms
And scared to make an honest woman out of her
And make her your bride, fake pimps, you ain't even alive
At least I can say I tried plus enjoyed the ride
Plus we got our little boy, my little joy and pride
He got my nose, my grill, your color, your eyes
Next go round I hope I pick the truest type
And watch me do it all again – it’s a beautiful life, aight?
Goodbye!  Baby.. baby
You know I'm saying bye-bye 
I can't believe that this is happening to us
'Cause I'm saying bye-bye 
I guess you knew and blew a good thing
You know I'm saying bye-bye
I guess you knew and blew a good thing, baby 'Til we make love just one more time
Make it seem forever
This is our last and final goodbye
Goodbye

Uh-huh
That's right
It was all good just a week ago
Uh-huh-uh, it was all good just a week ago
Last week I had everything
Uh, uh-huh-uh, had this all good just a week ago
I had the money.. had the cars, the bitches
Uh-huh, yeah, it was all good just a week ago
And the jewelry..
And then my motherfuckin' niggas started snitchin'
Uh-huh, uh uh, yo, yo
Beatch! Growin' up in the hood, just my dog and me
We used to hustle in the hood for all to see
Problems; I called on him, he called on me
We wasn't quite partners, I hit him off my P
Let him unlock doors off my keys
Yeah, we spoke, much more than cordially
Man, he broke bread with me, my business spread swiftly
The Feds came to get me, we both fled quickly
Wasn't quick enough to jump over the hedges with me
Got caught, and that's when our relationship strayed
Used to call me from the joint 'til he ran out of change
And when he called collect and I heard his name
I quickly accepted, but when I reached the phone
He's talkin' reckless, I can sense deceit in his tone
I said: Damn, dog! What, nine weeks and you're home?
He said: Main man, you think shit's sweet 'cause you're home.
I just sat, spat no more speech in the phone
Them crackers up there bleachin' your dome, you're reachin'
I said: The world don't stop, I got to keep..keep on.
From there I sensed the beef was on
I ran to the spy store to add some more features on my phone
To see if I had bugs and leeches on my phone
Can't be too safe, ‘cause niggas is two-faced
And they show the other side, when they catch a new case
It's on It was cool when you had hella weed to smoke
And you bought a new home where you could keep the folks
I don't see how this side of you could be provoked
Uh-huh, uh-huh, it was all good just a week ago
Funny what seven days can change
A stand up nigga, now you sit down to aim
Used to have a firm grip, now you dropping names
It was all good just a week ago Like I put the toast to your head and made you sell
We both came in this game, blind as hell
I did a little better, had more clientele
Told you put away some cheddar, now you cryin' for bail
Seventeen and I'm holdin' on to around a mill'
I could bail out, blow trial and come around on appeal
Had niggas thinkin' I was from uptown for real
I had so much hustle, plus I was down to ill
Like a Brooklyn nigga, straight out of Brownsville
Down and dirty, down to fight to round 30
Freezin' on them corners, still holdin' my crack
Lookin' up and down the block, the fuck is the dough at?
Came from flat broke to lettin' the dough stack
You tell them Feds I said: I'm never going back
I'm from Marcy, and Marcy don't raise no rats
You know the consequences of your acts, you can't be serious It was cool when you had hella weed to smoke
And you bought a new home where you could keep the folks
I don't see how this side of you could be provoked
Uh-huh, uh-huh, it was all good just a week ago
Funny what seven days can change
A stand up nigga, now you sit down to aim
Used to have a firm grip, now you dropping names
It was all good just a week ago The lawyer I retained you said you leakin' some things
All this after a week in the bing
I'm mad at myself, 'cause I didn't spot the weakling
I would've bet the house you wouldn't speak a thing
Nigga, this was the oath, to the top or broke
Even pricked our finger, anything that got between us
We supposed to cock the ninas, what happened to that?
Instead you copped out to a misdemeanor
Fuck it, the same thing make you laugh make you cry 
The same game that make you math could make you die
 It's a dice game, and sometimes you crap
Who would've thought you'd get popped one time and rat?
Now you know that's bad when your sister is mad
And your son gotta grow up, like, This is my dad?
The labeling of a snitch is a lifetime scar
You'll always be in jail, nigga, just minus the bars It was cool when you had hella weed to smoke
And you bought a new home where you could keep the folks
I don't see how this side of you could be provoked
Uh-huh, uh-huh, it was all good just a week ago
Funny what seven days can change
A stand up nigga, now you sit down to aim
Used to have a firm grip, now you dropping names
It was all good just a week ago Shit is crazy man
All these niggas out here snitchin'
We was one step away from takin' this crack money
And recyclin' it through the ghettos
And buildin' back up our own hoods
Now all you niggas start snitchin' on each other
I got partners doin' 15-20
Wouldn'ta been doin' SHIT
If you didn't snitch, beatch!
It's about time y'all check that shit out man
It ain't all good, shut your mouth
Just watch the game
And don't snitch
We'd sure go a lot whole further
Believe that baby
Jay-Z, Short Dawg's in the house mane
You know I got it
Got it goin' on
We got the money
Ain't got nuthin' to do with crime baby
But I'm recognizin' You rat bastard!
Today… Today… Today… Today… Today… Today… Today… Today… Today…
I feel like
I feel like
I feel like Bumping some shawty
Rollin my window down and hitting the highway
No its not Friday
But its my day
And sometimes shit gotta go my way
Niggas got me fucked up
Thinking that my music don’t stick like some nunchucks
Top dawg and we all stars like we run chucks
But never mind that
Take a trip to outer space show you where my mind at
You know where my grind at
Inside of the studio where I spend my time at
Fuck over the game til' I make that bitch climax
Miss me with that bullshit haters die young
You can run to the poor pit
Pullin' off the pit stop
Car like a flip flop
Bitches clap at me like they wanna make my piss hot
I don’t even trip doe I don’t need no company
Me, I’m thinkin long term tryna' build a company
Kendrick the good kid As I move I feel way better doing me I can only do me
I hope that you do you I think to myself truthfully I can only feel later
Some people say that I’m rude but I don’t give a damn if she if he if them or they say
I’m uncool nothin' but change how I feel bout' me today Nigga, what I depose be so potent
That if the earth dried I could spit back the ocean
Then hop on a jet-ski and start West-Coastin'
I’m not boastin' or braggin' not a person I’m a dragon
Takin' action in the heat of the night
So if the devil came tell him that I be alright
I’m so high off life that I can OD
Walk outside then sniff a whole key
Old lady done called the police
Its just an average Joe walkin' with his heart on his Pendex
Don’t be afraid to speak
So to speak you niggas not within arm reach
Y’all midget Max swingin' on Shaq now have a seat
You can never coexist with my momma’s oldest
Kendrick be thy name
I got my mind right
My nigga locked in the pin, that's what my mind write
Ink over my brain
What's up As I move I feel way better doing me I can only do me
I hope that you do you I think to myself truthfully I can only feel later
Some people say that I’m rude but I don’t give a damn if she if he if them or they say
I’m uncool nothin' but change how I feel bout' me today So let me start off the third verse
Pickin' up your favorites is our curse
Fuck the system, fuck the truth, fuck religion
Fuck the government, fuck the law, fuck the prisons
Fuck George Bush, fuck rappers who love dissin'
Fuck you because you don’t see my vision
I fucked your new girlfriend too
Because she’s cute and the ass
Looks like a grenade within the denim
Fuck the groupies, fuck the gossipin' bitches
Fuck niggas that can’t fight so pull triggas'
Fuck the new world gas price that cost a livin'
Fuck your love fuck your hate fuck your snitchin'
Whether you fuck with me or not
I don’t give a fuck you can keep your props
Fuck keepin' it real
I'm a keep it K-dot
Kendrick everyday Jay-Z didn’t lie
Fucker As I move I feel way better doing me I can only do me
I hope that you do you I think to myself truthfully I can only feel later
Some people say that I’m rude but I don’t give a damn if she if he if them or they say
I’m uncool nothin' but change how I feel bout' me today Today… Today… Today…Today… Today… Today…Today… Today… Today…
You are who you associate with
Look around at your five closest friends
And that's who you are
If you don't want to be that person
You know what you gotta do Association breeds similarity
That's why I'ma stay with real rich niggas
'til six niggas carry me
Poverty's a mind state
Time waits for no man, but no man
Wants to die a poor man with no plan Association breeds similarity
That's why I'ma stay with real rich niggas
'til six niggas carry me
Poverty's a mind state
Time waits for no man, but no man
Wants to die a poor man with no plan You can try to kill me, but I come back
Hate me, that's a small thing
Demons let the sword swing and sever off my offspring
Bitches try to see me down, hugging the floor
Bullets pulling me, playing tug of war
With my body, gravity got me
Police want me arrested, just to see me naked
Snakes want my necklace, fake niggas make me set-trip
Thugs shooting reckless 
Wonder, how will I exit 
Think you a killer, get cement shoes in the river
You should watch them people with you
Let them street rules hit you
If you hang around snitches, you get judged for that
'Cause you condone it, you know there ain't no love for that
There's slugs for that
Oh, you didn't know your man was talking?
That's why you stand with him, 'til you both land in the coffin
When you first heard he was snitching, then you should have thought
Every time this nigga got caught selling, they let him walk
Early on a nigga was taught, stay away from them niggas
So a nigga like Nas got nothing to say to them niggas
I fuck with, only the trusted thug clique
Who really done shit, run up in your bitch, bust the gun quick Association breeds similarity
That's why I'ma stay with real rich niggas
'til six niggas carry me
Poverty's a mind state
Time waits for no man, but no man
Wants to die a poor man with no plan Some bitches lie a lot, they could be fly or not
Actresses cry a lot, their girlfriends spy a lot
They can shake your hand, girl
Then they take your man, girl
The whole hood knowing
We got something good going
None of these hoes is after me
'Til they saw us happy and that you bagged me
Now they wishing that they had me
So watch who you hang with, and who you cling with
You know these bitches ain't shit, they hoping to bank chips
 after she done gave him some head
 he gang it and he left her for dead
Birds of a feather fly together
But chickens don't fly, they eat their own shit and die
And you affiliated, now you look weak
'Cause your peeps is freaks
Credit card stealing hoes, well known in the streets
And they brought your down in the dirt
You was a pretty, young, smart thing
Going to work, I bet it hurt
'Cause you had a clean rep
But the girls you seen with make these niggas say
I bet that bitch suck a mean dick, word Association breeds similarity
That's why I'ma stay with real rich niggas
'til six niggas carry me
Poverty's a mind state
Time waits for no woman, but no woman
Wants to die a poor woman with no man Association breeds similarity
That's why I'ma stay with real rich niggas
'til six niggas carry me
Poverty's a mind state
Time waits for no woman, but no woman
Wants to die a poor woman with no man A warrior walk alone, there's one spot on this throne
Fake friends be off and on, but a man stand up on his own
I'm raised by a different code, cut from a different cloth
Never been a follower, my momma told me be a boss
Watch who you hang around, don't let nobody bring you down
Friends come and go like seasons, leaves turn to brown
And some only come around when everything is green
Be careful not to let a snake infiltrate your team
For every Jesus there's a Judas, every Caesar there's a Brutus
If somebody tell you jump off a bridge -- are you gon' do it?
There's two types of influence: either healthy or deadly
Keep your circle small, away from all the hate and the envy
Don't come nowhere near me with it, I'm bullshit intolerant
My politics bosses up, for you black empowerment
I stay in my element, Braveheart intelligent
Only associate with those for my betterment
I'm out for dead presidents to represent mines
Only click with my kind, my best friend is my grind
Everybody got big dreams, but few follow through
And it's deep: the company you keep become apart of you
Don't just be sitting around smoking weed, letting time fly
If your homies don't inspire you to rise, tell 'em bye
You're better off dolo than rolling with a weak ass crew
I'm like Scarface: Who I trust? -- Me, that's who Association breeds similarity
That's why I'ma stay with real rich niggas
'til six niggas carry me
Poverty's a mind state
Time waits for no woman, but no woman
Wants to die a poor woman with no man Association breeds similarity
That's why I'ma stay with real rich niggas
'til six niggas carry me
Poverty's a mind state
Time waits for no woman, but no woman
Wants to die a poor woman with no man
And this is for the homies
I'm talking bout the swap meets, Rollie
Chain-wearing niggas with the white tee
Baby tell the truth, yeah you know we... Somebody get ready to pass me the hit of that endo, I'm tryna get blown
I'm tryna get turned up like the fifteens in my Cadillac Brougham
Looking for E.T. to phone home
Tadow, the flavor I kick reminisce the good days
Thinking back when we used to run in the swap meet for the Rollie chains
Pro Club t-shirts, whiter than Anglo-Saxons
Make it a 1X-Tall, crispy with the cotton fashion
That's fashion if you come where I'm from
Compton California, One love to the murder capital under the sun
Young niggas running around the street with heat bigger than me
But I don't trip, I still dip like salsa to a chip
Rolling down Rosecrans to scoop up my man, A-Mack
He talking about some foolishness on how we can pick up on some hoes, believe that
And so I scooped him round 3:30, Telling me it's all good
Tiger Woods, Now we looking for the birdy birdies
Stopped at the sto' to get some rubbers
Pulled up on the breezies, Well what do you know? I think they love us And this is for the homies
I'm talking bout the swap meets, Rollie
Chain-wearing niggas with the white tee
Baby tell the truth, yeah you know we got it going on
And if you feel good 
Raise your hands high and throw up your hood 
Represent the city like you know you should 
I want to make sure that you understood we got it going on
 We got it going on
 We got it going on
 We got it going on
 We got it going on As I continue my day, quite copacetic
Headed to my momma's house to see what them greens are talking bout, hungry as hell
Had the right grub, I bail, need some gas
ARCO station on Avalon, a relative hit me up as he rolled past
We used to stand in line for Jordans, excited we got 'em
Rocking platinum FUBU jeans with rubber bands tied to the bottom
Throwback jerseys, Chamberlain and James Worthy was two of my favorites
I might pull out the green Larry Bird on special occasions
But anyway I'm steady coasting, smoking on that Hiroshima
Ashtray got a million roaches, I'm focussed but feeling good
The homies hanging on {?} and Monte Carlos
Impalas and Tahoes, shoot something nigga, break that fifty
I'm grabbing the city like I'm supposed to
Making my presence felt like Christmas day, what can I say?
Every vocal is spoken with the wisdom of a G
If you can't relate then please have a seat So, wherever you located, won't you let it be known
And put on for the soil of which you was grown
I put on like brand new Chuck Taylors
While giving you cuts like fresh tapers
I'm such a fool with it, go nuts
You bullshitting like Tuck, the bounce then untuck
The bounce then throw up, a rare jewel, you duck
Take 'em to school I must, this for the cool in us
This ain't for you, so what?!

This here's a ballad for all the fallen soldiers 
I'm 'bout to show you how a hustlers life 
And a soldier's life, parallel
And the one thing they got in common is a mother's pain

Picture split screen 
On one side we got a hustler getting ready for the block 
Other side you got the soldier 
They're both at war
Stay with us Did you ever notice, before you think, life goes fast
So don't you worry, about what you see, it will pass You lost him mama, the war's calling him
Feel it's his duty to fall in line with all of them
He's a soldier
Rose through the ranks as the head of your household
Now its time to provide bank, like he's supposed ta
Now just remember why he's gone 'til November
It's part of him growing up
His shirts soaks up your tears as he holds ya
Your heart beating so fast speeding his pulse up
Yeah I know it sucks, life ain't all rosebuds
A couple of speed bumps, you gotta take your lumps
Off to boot camp, the worlds facing terror
Bin Laden been happening in Manhattan
Crack was anthrax back then, back when
Police was Al'Qaeda to black men
While I was out there hustling sinning with no religion
He was off to war killing for a living Did you ever notice, before you think, life goes fast
So don't you worry, about what you see, it will pass Days turn to nights, nights turn to years
Years turn to, How the fuck we make it in here?
My barracks average couple fights a day
Get you locked in a hole won't see the light of day
And I feel like I'm just writing my life away
I never thought shit could end up quite this way
There's a war going on outside no man is safe from
I'm here for the good fight only the fakes run
I'm here for the purple heart, if I can't take one
For my team or my siblings whats my reason for living?
I love my niggas more than anything else
This war's about my family, me needing the wealth
You don't understand how useless as men we felt
'Til you become a 5 star general
Shout out to my niggas that's locked in jail
P.O.W.'s that's still in the war for real, for real Did you ever notice, before you think, life goes fast
So don't you worry, about what you see, it will pass Your baby boy is getting grown
So your baby boy is moving on
I've gotta chase it
I'm gon' chase it
And I'm gon' make it, gon' make it
Yeah, your baby boy is getting grown
So your baby boy is moving on
I'm gonna make it, I'm gon' make it
Even if I gotta chase it
You gotta take it, wooo, yeah Mama say prayer your son's becoming a man
This wars taxing to 'em like Uncle Sam
He ain't gon' always make the right choice, understand
Every choice that he make he makes it for his fam
It's death before dishonor
And if he's gone you should honor his memory
Don't cry we all gonna die eventually
But if he's locked in the penitentiary send him some energy
They all winners to me, what's up Emory Did you ever notice, before you think, life goes fast
So don't you worry, about what you see, it will pass
Yeah..
I want all my niggas to come journey with me
My name is Nas, and the year is 1973
Beginning of me, therefore, I could see
Through my belly button window, who I am... I existed in a womb, just like an abyss
Came from behind the sun, my hands balled in a fist
Punching on my moms stomach, kicking on her cervix
Twitching 'cause I'm nervous, though my intended purpose
Was to be born to reign, not in scorn or vain
But to take on a name, my pops chose for me
Bloodstream full of indo, developing eyes
Nine-months process, infant size
A prophet in his early stages, mother in her early thirties
Was married to pops, wishing what she carried would drop
I'm not worthy to come from a woman so pure, Ann Jones
Flesh of her flesh, blood of her blood, her blood and bones
Hearing prayers, she asking for my good health
That I'd become a man and learn to make a way for myself
Nervous she was, and her paranoia got in my blood
Mixed with marijuana from my daddy's genes
Lot of screams I'm hearing, it's crazy, both parents is scrapping
I'm not even a baby, a miscarriage could happen I shot my way out my mom dukes
I shot my way out my mom dukes
I shot my way out my mom dukes
I shot my way out my mom dukes Yo, they must wanna keep me, 'cause four months pass, I'm still alive
Guess I got what you call an Ill Will to survive
When I look hard, the lights is killing my eyes
I know when moms layin down, I get bored, start to get live
Move side to side, hear loud music and vibe
All black babies are born with rhythm, that's no lie
Solar energize, mineralize food flowing through my mother's tube
I'm covered in this thick layer of goo
Month two was the least most comfortable
My umbilical cord choking me, but month three was closer, see
That's when pops took moms to see the doc at the clinic
But I was saved, he changed his mind in the last minute
Watching 'em yell, heard my moms voice well
Feared fist fights, so terrified when we fell
While they broke up furniture and smashed plates on the wall
I wondered, If I am born, will I be safe at all?
This place they call the world though my view was so large
Couldn't wait to get up, grow up and take charge
Month five, month six went by, hoping I'm born in July
But the Lord already figured out a date and time
September 14th, 73
Get ready, world, doctor's in the front waiting for me
Arms open 'cause they know when I drop, a lot of shit's gon' stop
See how the government start retraining cops
Month nine, I'm a week overdue, the labor induced
Pops told my moms to push and take deep breaths too
Said Stay calm, holding her arm, I'm trying to hold on
Surgical gloves touching my scalp, my head pops out
Everything is blurry, my first breath screams out
Tears pouring down my pops face, he's so proud
Wanting to hold me, but I was so bloody
They washed me off and he say, At least that nigga ain't ugly
Placed me in his arms snugly, laid me on my mother
Finally, I got to see who held me in her body, she loved me
And yo, I plan to overthrow the Devil
And y'all bout to see this world in trouble, motherfuckers {*Doctor slaps the baby; the baby screams*}

 She an angel with them devil horns, yeah
Devil horns, yeah, devil horns, yeah
Never met a girl like this before, yeah
This before, yeah, this before, yeah
She put my belongings at the door, yeah
At the door, yeah, at the door, yeah
Close the coffin, put it in a morgue, yeah
In a morgue, yeah, in a morgue yeah, yeah She was like the girls from the movies
Everybody saying she gon' use me
She really had me looking like a fool, who am I fooling?
She was way more than a groupie
Pretty like a fresh pair of Gucci
She give me brain and she smoke on them loosies, so loosely
I told her nothing ever really moves me
So I don't know why she got me up in my feelings
And I don't know if it's agony that I'm feeling
But I'm feeling Na na na na, na na na
I regret everything that I said
Drink my sorrows and regrets away, away She an angel with them devil horns, yeah
Devil horns, yeah, devil horns, yeah
Never met a girl like this before, yeah
This before, yeah, this before, yeah
She put my belongings at the door, yeah
At the door, yeah, at the door, yeah
Close the coffin, put it in a morgue, yeah
In a morgue, yeah, in a morgue yeah, yeah As the liquor kicks in, she's swimming through my head
Her hands in my dreads, yeah
Fill me up with dread
Watch as she goes, as I come too close
To my overdose, she won't hold me close
If she does the most, yeah I mean the most of the pills
And the Henny, I ain't living on my own Na na na na, na na na na
Na na na na, na na na na
Na na na na, na na na na
Na na na na, na na na na Na na na na, na na na
I regret everything that I said
Drink my sorrows and regrets away, away She an angel with them devil horns, yeah
Devil horns, yeah, devil horns, yeah
Never met a girl like this before, yeah
This before, yeah, this before, yeah
She put my belongings at the door, yeah
At the door, yeah, at the door, yeah
Close the coffin, put it in a morgue, yeah
In a morgue, yeah, in a morgue yeah, yeah
How could I fly, but lose it all
I'm a cannonball
Maybe you'll walk away, maybe you'll walk away
Set me up, and let me off
I'm a cannonball Like my big bro say, I'm goin in
Olimpic loser money, I just glad I learned to swim
CAnnonball, bitch, I hope dive untill it's 30
And I hope when dinners cold, my fingers do not dessert me
And these haters like, damb m
Gave a lot of women they first ride in the phantom
And yeah, I got a deal now, and I'm secure with it
And yet my life is so exciting, I get bored with it
I'm the best one out of my peers, and everybody pray I'm running out of ideas
Past my MOs, cause I shine so bright
And I'm the result of when it all goes right
So many pictures, man, the floor is a collage
Critics have hard time pointing out the flaws
All this slick talk, I just hope I don't fall
Right out of the sky, through the roof of your garage How could I fly, but lose it all
I'm a cannonball
Maybe you'll walk away, maybe you'll walk away
Set me up, and let me off
I'm a cannonball

First I see a flashin' light, then on my own
I hear nothin', the smell of fire in brimstone
I feel hundreds arms grabbin' me, fallin' down the hole
Is it because there is no Gravity my body leaves my Soul
Is the Devil mad at me? will I go to Hell?
Or is it Heaven that awaits me?, is too early to tell
Is it now that I'm to be judged?
Will I face thee bright tunnel warm lights?
Will embrace me before force takes me
Like I'm movin' through high winds
See my self in baby carriages, relatives and friends
Things manifest, kings from every planets rest here
Beams of light hear the voice of the Nazareth near You 'Amongst Kings' from both far near land
Made in my image son of God son of man
You came in the spirit for I am that I am
Father of all worlds Fallen Angel and the Lamb Seen my body layin' down in the ground
It was painless, didn't feel a thing
Shots ring felt the anxious to get up and run
I was atheist, committed Suicide
I wish I could erase this shit
I seen a new life before the Christ
He created night & day, the sun & moon
From the virgin woman's womb
We lookin' down at my body, emergency room
Doctors frownin' at me surgical performs, I'm doomed
It's my day of judgment, eternal peace & fire
Far past the stars far past the Orion
I asked that you forgive father, I was tryin'
Many thrones in the light but only one's truly shinin' Faster then the blinkin' eye, is the master and I
Face to face 
Countin' all my sins , where do we begin
When I stabbed the man in the train station or drunk gin
When I grabbed the man let the shells hit him from the Mac 10
It was all retaliation,  from way back then
Now I got the black Benz 
Disney World for my little girl and I'm askin'
You would recognize all the good deeds I'm worth 
Send me on a trip God please the Earth
So I can deliver thou want it, stop playin'
He gave me life, I screamed out loud that I Am...

Clothe wit the cloud 
And the rainbow was upon his head as a Crown 
And his face was lit as were the Sun 
And his feet as pillars of fire 
And his name was Nastradamus 

Nas...
Nas...
Nas...
It's amazing, I'm the reason
Everybody fired up this evening
I'm exhausted, barely breathing
Holding on to what I believe in No matter what, you'll never take that from me
My reign is as far as your eyes can see
It's amazing, so amazing, so amazing, so amazing 
It's amazing I'm a monster, I'm a killer
I know I'm wrong
I'm a problem
That'll never ever be solved I'm a monster, I'm a maven
I know this world is changing
Never gave up, never gave in
I'm the only thing I'm afraid of So amazing, so amazing, so amazing No matter what, you’ll never take that from me
My reign is as far…
Bring it back down though It's amazing, I'm the reason
Everybody fired up this evening
I'm exhausted, barely breathing
Holding on to what I believe in
No matter what, you'll never take that from me
Never take that from me No take it back down, take it back, keep going It feels like you're on trial sometimes
And in a relationship, you can also be on trial
And be convicted with no jury And this song was sort of like that moment where someone tells you ain't, you ain’t - you gotta say I am - an emancipation, if you will
Cause you can't take that from me
My self-esteem So whether it something in your own home, or a situation like mine
Where you're under the microscope of the media Never let them take that from you
I never let them, let them take that from me You have to be amazing sometimes
I and I know I do not always state popular opinion Amazing, Michael Jackson, amazing
Michael Phelps, amazing
OJ Simpson, amazing
Is he not?!
What he did when he did what he did, was he not amazing though? I think I saw in a movie - I get my quotes from movies cause I don't read
Or from like, go figure, real life or something
Like live real live, talk to real people, get information, ask people, questions
And it was something about, you either die a superhero or you live to become the villain
I'M CHILLIN' *Kanye chicken noise* I'm chillin' So many times they try to make me out to be the villain
I don't understand what I did
I apologize for acting like a bitch at award-shows
It's an award-show, didn't kill anyone
But yet and still I apologize for my ungraciousness I was a spoiled little Chicago-boy, who got all these awards as he came in the door and people clapped and sang his praises
And he soaked it all up and believed his own hype
To the point where he could not lose
And if anyone didn't pick him, they could not choose
As he swooves with the who's-who's and broke all the rules
And even lost his cool
Hey, nothing new
Now they don't like you, hey they don't like you
Look at what you've done boy, trying to be the number one boy And I'm thirty-one years now and I've leaned from my mistakes Just play pianos... Super-hero music, pain This hardcore, so hardcore
That's why I sing: I'm a monster, I'm maven
I know this world is changing
Never gave up, never gave in
I'm the only thing I'm afraid of
No matter what, you'll never take that from me
My reign is as far as your eyes can see
It's amazing
It's what you all been waiting for ain't it
Your weekly entertainment
For me to get a hold of this beat and go 'head, claim it
I'm about to paint a picture, you niggas go 'head, frame it
Since we gettin Seinfeld on some Jerry and Elaine shit
I flow far from mediocre
And if we talking cards I will fold him with the poker
You and your whole crew are like a deck of 54
So it's obvious ya'll gone steady be rollin with some jokers
And me I'm rolling with some brokers
Like damn could you niggas get any broker?
I got my new girl so content
Just save yourself the embarrassment, don't even approach her
Disguise your self, go buy a costume
I am making stock works, while you working stock rooms
 and I was praying I would drop June
But label reps applying pressure to make them pop tunes
So I keep it rocking for Pete's sakes
You fake gangsta rappers a cliché
And if you ain't talking dough when you meet Drake
I'll be all in your face like, No speak-a la ingles
Soon as you hear it you quote it
They try to be the one that I done left out the show with
But trust me I'm aware, and my cars right there
Is this interior enough for ya'll ulterior motives
'Cause if you like it ya'll should stick with me
My money good, I ain't never had to flip a ki
Alotta ice, alotta cream like Dickey Dee
Might cut the phone and disapear like Mishy Me
But I'mma try and have you on the trip with me
Slid in threw a Henri Bendel like it's slippery
And your ex man is a hater officially
Probably 'cause he know I'm exactly what you wish he be
Yeah that's the reason why he looking hard
'Cause I've done snatched the Chips Ahoy out the cookie jar
He just mad 'cause his girl's at the house
With her tongue sticking out like a Michael Jordan rookie card
Let me address this, pardon me while I fix
A couple subliminal lines caught me in the mix
I guess he thought he could of been Gotti in the flix
But at this point I'm just poking a body with a stick
Nowadays rapping is a children's hobby
And girls keep telling me I'm still this snobby
I tell them myself who I am feeling probably
Just because I got a buzz like a building lobby
It ain't a song that your ass finna skipp
I tried to sell weed, give me cash for this zip
The way your girlfriend pumped me up in the car
Seem like she don't really need no gas for the trip
Millionaire shades, fade with the waves
I smirk at a nigga if he still rocking braids
That just let's me know that we ain't on the same page
And that goes out to every nigga except Trey
I'm outta here baby
They asked me about the past years and how does it phase me
I wouldn't take it back, nah, not if they pay me
Mr. betcha that's expensive 'cause it's not a fugazi
Spittin' a Crock Pot of bottomless gravy
The shit is so nasty, how is it tasty?
And you can probably find him walking out of a Macy's
Forget it girl, they just thinking how to replace me
Exit with a joke, leave these niggas some hope
You took that Ye beat and put that shit in a choke
Well I'm thinking I should leave out on this note
Nigga keep your two cents I ain't tryna leave you broke Life of a Don, lights keep glowing
Come up in the club with that fresh shit on
And something crazy on my arm, uh-ahem
And here's another hit, Barry BondsYo, this is Nas, the rebel to America
I load the clips 'til my lips are crass, cracked
Like a vet buggin' out from flashbacks
My raps, I shoot at your skull and leave ya sprung
I'm wavin' automatic guns at nuns
Paragraph wizard makin' mics malfunction
I blow the fuse with the style I choose
Science is dropped, my raps are toxic
My voice-box locks and excels like a rocket
Nas assassinates the Pope with a scope
I mutilate mics 'til my voice-box is broke
Try to battle me and gasp for breath
Words I speak is a step beyond death
A rappin' Charles Manson, I'm just that odd
I'm so strong, long enough to box with God
I throw a pitch at your brain so try and catch it
My thought are bugged
My brains should be put in a straitjacket
I'm nastier than cannibalism
I'm as sharp as a shank in prison, thoughts abrupt, risen
My rap is a ritual of Satan
Though I'm not demonic, my voice is electronic
My brain is deranged
In a metamorphic change, my sound waves are strange
Many say that I'm propelled to Hell
But I met the Devil and wrecked his brain cell
Police murderer, I love to kill a black cop
Nasty Nas is as deadly as a crack spot
And smoke a mic like a fiend
I use a TEC 9 like I was ???????
I go on till the break of dawn
Breakin' raps in half, my word is bond
It's like that and, uh, I go on and on
Akinyele, rock the mic till the mic is tornGreetings loved ones
Let's take a journey I know a place
Where the grass is really greener
Warm, wet n' wild
There must be something in the water
Sippin' gin and juice
Laying underneath the palm trees

Yeah, for the dogs dem, you know
Man when shit gets like this, man the whole city
Shit's crazy right now, and shit ain't gonna stop
Know shit gonna get a lot more worse before it get any better Look, momma hit my phone and said rap's no good
Better than her telling me the check's no good
Now they wanna act like I do no good
Funny 'cause I really did more than I should
I made a decision last night that I would die for it
Just to show the city what it takes to be alive for it
Can't get me on the line so they hang me out to dry for it
You know 40 wants peace but I'm down to cut ties for it
And I can't sleep these days unless I take one
If they don't have a story these days, they'll make one
Life is always on, man, I never get a break from it
Doesn't matter where I go, I can never get away from it
They give me loyalty and I don't gotta pay for it
Same way, breads gotta break for it
Keeping people fed is my only peace of mind now
And I turn the six upside down, it's a nine now
I made a decision last night that I would die for it 


 All these hand outs, man it's getting outta hand
I'ma start telling niggas Get it how you can
I got it right now so I'm everybody's friend
If I ever lose I bet we never speak again
I made a decision last night, I'd die for it
Just to show the city what it takes to be alive for it
First place, first place, man we can't be tied for it
I only drove it five times, paid 1.5  for it
Keychain go jang-a-lang, I wanna do major things
MJ in every way, I just don't fade away
Six upside down, it's a nine now
Like Mannie, like Stunna, man, shit is big time now
And I made a decision last night that I would die for it 


 Make me feel the same way that I did to you
Trust me when I say I thought it all through
Trust me when I say that shit is old moves
God made himself a way from me to you
Tried to kill me but they still want the Views
Tried to kill me but they still want the Views
Tried to kill me but I am very much alive on the six side
Yeah, I said I am very much alive on the six side
I said I am....
It's the Roc! Wooo!
Nike Airs is right 
My bucket is low 
My Rocawear is fittin' incredible Fuck it, I guess I got my swagger back
Mama, they said I killed a man
Well, I guess I got the dagger back

In the heezy
Jigga Man, B. Sige to M-Easy 
Oschino and Sparks and Freeweezy 
Mickey, Mallory, Chris and Neef, hey!
All I need is the love of my crew
The whole industry can hate me, I thugged my way through
And all I need is a chick that hold a jammy
Like Meth and Mary, like Marvin and Tammi, uhh
Now understand we can't be stopped
From blowin' Swisher Sweets outta candy drops
Like we underground kings, ridin' dirty
A nigga been focused since I said hi to 30 
Young niggas, y'all can't hurt me
Better watch and observe me
And learn how to earn better, I burn cheddar
I set fire to your empire
I blow smoke in your face, burn rubber off of rim tires
Yes I-ah, Jay I-ah...
Double G-A, livewire nigga, holla back! All I need...
Rocawear... 
Nike Airs... 
Mean bucket... 
Armadale in the club, couple of duckets 
Couple chicks by my side, let's ride
All I need...
That new coupe 
A doo-rag and a pocket full of loot 
A sunny day some chicks that wanna play
And I'll be on my way Come on… now
All I need in this world of sin
Is me and my girlfriend! 
I got a little two-two, I call her Peggy Sue
When I'm off in the club she fit right in my shoe 
Gotta switch her to my waist, just in case 
A clown wanna flip, gotta reach for my bitch
Wanna act out a movie, I could give you a clip 
But no ad-libbin', nigga, stick to the script
Now all, I, need is a high-priced lawyer
'Cause it's foul ways nowadays, everybody saw you
And they comin' to court too, I thought you knew
Can't even steal on a nigga, muh'fuckas will sue
In this time and age, what's a real muh'fucka to do
When I'm surrounded by squeal muh'fuckas like you?
But real niggas don't fret 'cause the number one crew
R to the O to the C comin' true All I need...
Rocawear... 
Nike Airs... 
Mean bucket... 
Armadale in the club, couple of duckets 
Couple chicks by my side, let's ride

A doo-rag and a pocket full of loot 
A sunny day some chicks that wanna play
And I'll be on my way Listen, the cream too long, my team too strong
Bleek is too hot, Beans is gone
Y'all niggas in the crosshair, the beams is on 
Y'all whole block deserted, y'all fiends are gone 
The whole Roc is jumpin', we reached our zenith
Got fiends throwin' up on themself like Willie Beamen 
Any given Sunday gunplay's optional
However niggas want it like Soul II Soul 
Whoever got hops get blocked, go to the hole
Dikembe Mutumbo of this rap shit
Plus the jab is sick, and it's Zab quick
Left hand'll lean 'em like a little past six
Now run along wit'cha little-ass hits
Read my rap sheet, nigga: three classics!
Shut your bumba', got A-Rod numbers
All you muddaskunks get buried in the trunk
When I blast the pump
I leave you relaxed in the hospital, lookin' at M*A*S*H for months
Then I dumps dough on the D.A. desk
And flee scot-free and pee-pee on the steps
We've got no respect, no law or governin'
Why you fuckin' with him?
Matter fact, why you fuckin' with them?
All y'all need is the R-O-C, baby All I need...
Rocawear... 
Nike Airs... 
Mean bucket... 
Armadale in the club, couple of duckets 
Couple chicks by my side, let's ride
All I need...

Damn, I'm dying to make you feel like a woman, baby
It was always me vs the world
Until I found it's me vs me
Why, why, why, why?
Why, why, why, why?
Just remember, what happens on Earth stays on Earth!
We gon' put it in reverse Darling, I told you many times
And I am telling you once again
Just to remind you, sweetheart
That my— Oh Lamar
Hail Mary and marijuana, times is hard
Pray with the hooligans, shadows all in the dark
Fellowship with demons and relatives, I'm a star
Life is one funny mothafucka
A true comedian, you gotta love him, you gotta trust him
I might be buggin', infomercials and no sleep
Introverted by my thoughts; children, listen, it gets deep
See, once upon a time inside the Nickerson Garden projects
The object was to process and digest poverty's dialect
Adaptation inevitable: gun violence, crack spot
Federal policies raid buildings and drug professionals
Anthony was the oldest of seven
Well-respected, calm and collected
Laughin' and jokin' made life easier; hard times, Momma on crack
A four-year-old tellin' his nanny he needed her
His family history: pimpin' and bangin'
He was meant to be dangerous
Clocked him a grip and start slangin'
Fifteen, scrapin' up his jeans with quarter pieces
Even got some head from a smoker last weekend
Dodged a policeman, workin' for his big homie
Small-time hustler, graduated to a brick on him
10,000 dollars out of a project housing, that's on the daily
Seen his first mil twenty years old, had a couple of babies
Had a couple of shooters
Caught a murder case, fingerprints on the gun they assumin'
But witnesses couldn't prove it
That was back when he turned his back and they killed his cousin
He beat the case and went back to hustlin'
Bird-shufflin', Anthony rang
The first in the projects with the two-tone Mustang
That 5.0 thing, they say 5-0 came
Circlin' parking lots and parking spots
And hoppin' out while harrassin' the corner blocks
Crooked cops told Anthony he should kick it
He brushed 'em off and walked back to the Kentucky Fried Chicken
See, at this chicken spot
There was a light-skinned nigga that talked a lot
With a curly top and a gap in his teeth
He worked the window, his name was Ducky
He came from the streets, the Robert Taylor Homes
Southside Projects, Chiraq, the Terror Dome
Drove to California with a woman on him and 500 dollars
They had a son, hopin' that he'd see college
Hustlin' on the side with a nine-to-five to freak it
Cadillac Seville, he'd ride his son around on weekends
Three-piece special with his name on the shirt pocket
'Cross the street from the projects, Anthony planned to rob it
Stuck up the place before, back in '84
That's when affiliation was really eight gears of war
So many relatives tellin' us, sellin' us devilish works
Killin' us, crime, intelligent, felonious
Prevalent proposition with 9's
Ducky was well-aware
They robbed the manager and shot a customer last year
He figured he'd get on these niggas' good sides
Free chicken every time Anthony posted in line
Two extra biscuits, Anthony liked him and then let him slide
They didn't kill him; in fact, it look like they're the last to survive
Pay attention, that one decision changed both of they lives
One curse at a time
Reverse the manifest and good karma, and I'll tell you why
You take two strangers and put 'em in random predicaments
Give 'em a soul so they can make their own choices and live with it
Twenty years later, them same strangers, you make 'em meet again
Inside recording studios where they reapin' their benefits
Then you start remindin' them about that chicken incident
Whoever thought the greatest rapper would be from coincidence?
Because if Anthony killed Ducky, Top Dawg could be servin' life
While I grew up without a father and die in a gunfight So, I was takin' a walk the other day…
Do I find it so hard
When I know in my heart
I'm letting you down every day
Letting you down every day
Why do I keep on running away? Look, I apologize, often womanize
Took for my child to be born, see through a woman's eyes
Took for these natural twins to believe in miracles
Took me too long for this song, I don't deserve you
I harassed you out in Paris
Please come back to Rome, you make it home
We talked for hours when you were on tour
“Please pick up the phone, pick up the phone!”
I said: “Don't embarrass me,” instead of “Be mine”
That was my proposal for us to go steady
That was your 21st birthday
You matured faster than me, I wasn't ready
So I apologize
I seen the innocence leave your eyes
I still mourn this death and
I apologize for all the stillborns 'cause I wasn't present
Your body wouldn't accept it
I apologize to all the women whom I toyed with your emotions
'Cause I was emotionless
And I apologize 'cause at your best you are love
And because I fall short of what I say I'm all about
Your eyes leave with the soul that your body once housed
And you stare blankly into space
Thinkin' of all the time, you wasted it on all this basic shit
So I apologize I'm never gonna treat you
I'm never gonna treat you like I should
Ohhhhhh I apologize, our love was one for the ages and I contained us
And all this ratchet shit and we more expansive
Not meant to cry and die alone in these mansions
Or sleep with our back turned
We supposed to vacay 'til our backs burn
We're supposed to laugh 'til our heart stops
And then meet in a space where the dark stop
And let love light the way
Like the men before me, I cut off my nose to spite my face
I never wanted another woman to know
Something about me that you didn't know
I promised, I cried, I couldn't hold
I suck at love, I think I need a do-over
I will be emotionally available if I invited you over
I stew over, what if you over my shit? I'm never gonna treat you
I'm never gonna treat you like I should
Ohhhhhh And if my children knew
I don't even know what I would do
If they ain't look at me the same
I would prob'ly die with all the shame
You did what with who?
What good is a ménage à trois when you have a soulmate?
You risked that for Blue?
If I wasn't a superhero in your face
My heart breaks for the day I have to explain my mistakes
And the mask goes away and Santa Claus is fake
And you go online and see
For Blue's tooth, the tooth fairy didn't pay I'm never gonna treat you like I should
Uh huh yea, yeah
Duro!
You gotta let it bump
Uh, uh, uh like dat yeah
Come on bring the chorus in I'd risk everything
For one kiss, everything
Yes I'd do anything 
Anything for you I’d do a bid, loose a rib, bust a cap, trust in that
Run up to heaven doors, exchange my life for yours
Leave a steak out the door, mi casa, su casa
Just remember to turn the lights off in the hall
My brother from another pop, minus one shot
We Nino and Gee Money man, we all we got
From the stoop to the big dudes, stoppin' us from playin' hoops
And us getting mad, throwing rocks off the roof
Straight thuggin' man, I thought we would never progress
But look at us now man, we're young execs
My nigga Dame, my nigga Biggs, my nigga Ty
My nigga High, my nigga Gotti
We embody all that’s right with the world
No matter how pretty she is, you never liking my girl
That's how we run, when you ain’t around
I'll spank ya son, keep him in line
If you should die, I’ll keep him like mine
God forbid, keep this in mind, my nigga I'd risk everything
For one kiss, everything
Yes I'd do anything 
Anything for you
I'd risk everything
For one kiss, everything
Yes I'd do anything 
Anything for you I know Momma, your little baby
But these streets raised me crazy
Product of my environment, nothing can save me
Thanks for letting me bloom for your wisdom for your womb
For the roof over my head, for my shoes, for my bed
For the most important lesson in life was when you said
Strive for what you believe in, set goals and you can achieve them
Thanks for the days you kept me breathing
When my asthma was bad and my chest was weezin'
Thanks for the look of love just as I was leaving
On nights you thought that I wouldn't come back, that left you grieving
Thanks for holdin' down the household when times was bad
As a man, I apologize for my dad
When the rent was due, you would hustle like a pimp would do
That wasn’t the life meant for you
You’re a queen, you deserve the cream, everything that gleamed
Everything that shines, everything that’s mine I'd risk everything
For one kiss, everything
Yes I'd do anything 
Anything for you
I'd risk everything
For one kiss, everything
Yes I'd do anything 
Anything for you Check it out, uh, uh
Dear nephews, I’m writing' this with no pen or a pad
And I’m signing it, ya uncle, ya best friend, and ya dad
Don't look back if you fall and you’re feeling bad
I’m right there from your cut to when you peelin' the scab
If it comes a time when you ain’t feelin' your real dad
Put my face on his body don’t wait for nobody
Don’t follow no nigga, that's ho shit man
Stand on your own two, do your shit man
The world is yours, some girls are nice some girls are whores
Don't listen to your crew, do what works for you
Standing back from situations gives you the perfect view
You see the snakes in the grass and you wait on their ass
Bite your tongue for no one and whatever is said
Take it how they want, a closed mouth don't get fed
You know my number when it’s code red if you're wrong my nigga
You're my nephew, fuck it we get it on my lil nigga I'd risk everything
For one kiss, everything
Yes I'd do anything 
Anything for you
I'd risk everything
For one kiss, everything
Yes I'd do anything 
Anything for you
I'd risk everything
For one kiss, everything
Yes I'd do anything 
Anything for you
I'd risk everything
For one kiss, everything
Yes I'd do anything 
Anything for youTime in my life I was down so low, a mosquito wouldn't even bite me
I lost my job, my 4 wheel drive, I even got throwed out of my trailer
All because of one thing: freebasing cocaine
That's all my life was, was basing, nothing else
I was on that last lap, with that checker flag
About to wave me on into hell
But I got lucky
I got into rehab program down der in Redstone Arsenal down
Der in Alabama and with dem people helpin' me
Well that smoking white devil is no longer a part of my life
I can proudly say, that white devil is no longer a part of my
Life and I can proudly say, that today, I do not freebase cocaine
Now I'll take a drink, now
I will take a drink but I do not freebase cocaine
You know, well, I take a drink and I might even smoke a little reefer
You know, you know I like to smoke reefer
You know, it relaxes me and everything
A couple doobies, you know, just ta get you through the day and everything
But, far as basin goes, I don't do it
Now I'll do some toot now. Don't get me wrong
I will do some toot you know. You know if you're partying and everything
And somebody comes up and gives it to you
Its impolite not to take it there
So me and my girlfriend, Sally, we, you know, we party man I tell you
We do party. You know, I will do some toot
We'll do, you know
On a good weekend there we call a bunch of friend over
We'll do bout an eight ball of toot there but we don't base
I do not freebase cocaine. I want to make that clear. I don't do it
Another life
Another day, another blunt
Another day, another lie, blunt
Another night, another day, another night, another...
 Another life, another day, another chance to make it great
I'm running to the money all the time so I can never be late
Just me and my bitch, even though she drive me crazy, she still make my day Going through motions, muddy emotions
Going through motions, muddy emotions
Going through motions, muddy emotions
Back on my bullshit, devil emoji
Going through motions, muddy emotions
Going through motions, muddy emotions
Going through motions, muddy emotions
Back on my bullshit, devil emoji Boat rocking back and forth, what's the commotion?
I told her I'ma drown in her, that bitch an ocean
If I can't make her smile, I'ma be acting wild
She got a new man, I'm gon' pull up on him and shoot him down
I been goin' through emotions, bloody emotions
Pour me a cup, I'ma nod out
Started pack smokin', good dope rollin'
Maybe Mary Jane'll help me put the pills down
Dead inside, catch a look at my ghost
I pull up in a Lambo' or 'Rari or Rolls
Got my girl by my side and they callin' us goals
Numb the pain, take these Percs to the mouth and the nose
I'm not a drug addict, got it all wrong
I'm just a love addict 'til my heart gone
I'm just a love addict with the love songs
You with me is where you belong Going through motions, muddy emotions
Going through motions, muddy emotions
Going through motions, muddy emotions
Back on my bullshit, devil emoji
Going through motions, muddy emotions
Going through motions, muddy emotions
Going through motions, muddy emotions
Back on my bullshit, devil emoji 
 Bass rocks, nigga; bass rocks, nigga
Get your cake up; cake up, nigga
Still in the loop like a hula hoop
Still connected like a router
Got a line on the powder
Still got a whole lot of power
Still the same muthafucka you met a while ago, a real one
Not a hoe, being thorough is all I know
I’m a pro at getting dough
Or should I say guap
If I had to, I could cook a ki in a wok
Bust my Glock, my 2-2 nickel across a hater face
Break his fuckin’ jaw, knock his teeth out so he can’t taste
Have him eating out a straw, for disrespecting a staple
Get your car riddled, split in half like a bagel
Fuckin’ around in the yola game, gotta be careful
They’ll rob for dinero, pull up in all-black apparel
Hit their target like an arrow
Shoot you in your bone marrow
Tear up out in a Chevy souped up Camaro
BIATCH!  See he throws the whole unit in a big ass gumbo pot
Foam, stir, let it settle to make it lot
Take it out of the oowop and let it dry
Doing what I gotta do to get by
Yola I supply, break it down into zips
Halfs, quarters, kibbles n bits
Overkill, extras, it’s all in the wrist
They’ll walk from Cali to Texas long as they get they fix
Pitching no-hitters and shutouts, you get my drift
The players on plug with that
I cop from them when the drought ‘bout to hit
Everybody that I know got a banger, extended clip
Rather be caught with than without, some real shit
He got too much time on his hands
I ain’t got no time to be playin’
He too busy trippin’ off somebody else’s wealth
I’m too busy stacking dollars taller than myself
BIATCH!  All money ain’t good money and every time ain’t the right time
I don’t be out here stuntin’, clumsy, looking like a plate of swidnine
I be under on the tuck, sitting soft with the seat reclined
Looking out for the smirchers, the kind that pull on the side
And try to slather a player, arm out the window from the blind
Hit your nigga at a exit, a light or a stop sign
Even I was broke, you wouldn’t know it ‘cause I’m hella laced
I hibernate ‘til I’m up again, won’t show my face
‘Cause they used to me looking a certain way, ‘bout my pay
Since the ‘80s I’ve been having it my way to this day
I’m an inner-city icon from the 7’s
Where they go from the shoulders and tote weapons
Got that fire like a welder, banked up like a ready teller
Correctional institution, revenge and retribution
They’ll steal you out here, mayne, and I ain’t talkin’ ‘bout boostin’
Be ‘bout it, my nigga, or do it movin’
BIATCH! 
She want a title
I'm in denial
Don't need a rifle
Everyone suicidal
Imma burn a bridge
I feel like a pyro
Imma say my prayers
I'll be hellbound tomorrow
I'm in my sorrow
Oxy-my-codone
Does someone have a heart
That I can borrow
Tear me apart
Does someone have a heart
That I can borrow, borrow, oh Time after time they let me drown in my sorrow
I went through the night, I only wish for tomorrow
Love, love, love, got me walking in circles

I'm living a lie
Ain't no you and I
Walking in circles
Something isn't right And I'm in denial
I don't need a rifle
Everyone suicidal
Imma burn a bridge
Feel like a pyro
Imma say my prayers
I'll be hellbound tomorrow
I'm in my sorrow
Oxy-my-codone
Does someone have a heart
That I can borrow
Tear me apart
Does someone have a heart
That I can borrow, borrow, borrow It's crazy how I feel, right
I wonder if this real life
Will I see tomorrow, tomorrow
You know there is always some big mouth-ass motherfucker talkin' shit. There's always some big mouth motherfucker hatin'. Always a nigga hatin'.

About something we did or supposed to do
You might not of heard it or maybe you have
But when I first heard it all I did was laugh
I used to get angry and all uptight
You can say what you want, just spell my name right
Cause all I'm ever guilty of is rockin' the house
But that's not what the rumor was all about
So if you like to hate tell all your friends
And if you don't wait until you see me again
This way I can hear it from the horses mouth
Right then and there we can straighten it out
Because I don't get involved with he said she said
So take my advice and quit while you ahead
Because one day I just might not laugh
I pull up and pop a cap in your ass You got a big mouth

Not something that you run and tell your crew
But you had to told Sharon and she told Carol
Then the story rolled on just like a wheelbarrow
Carol told Bibi and she told Pam
And Pam was overheard a-talking to her man
Pam was so rookie, what she thought she heard
And somehow my nigga Diddy Bop got the word
He told somebody I knew from fruit town
They called me up and put me down
Now the whole damn story's been changed around
And that's the reason why I ain't fucking with you now
'Cause you never shoulda opened your mouth at all
And I wouldn't a had no reason to make this call You got a big mouth

Bullet find a home in ya arteries, pardon me
But them niggas won't touch not a part of me, bet on it
Them niggas belong in a sorority, ain't that a bitch
Burn they bodies up for the authorities, no evidence
You gone stop fuckin' with them warriors from New Orleans
And, I really think that it'd be better if
I just hit your block with that beretta and hop out and let her rip
Let her bang, let her bust, etcetera, etcetera
You niggas is scared of the, southern part of America
Here it come, got a gun, never come without one
Niggas wanna ball, so I guess I gotta bounce 'em
Smokin' on an ounce of that shit from the mountains
People say I need to stop, no I need a counselor
And down here you are gonna need a chopper
And I'mma need a lawyer, and you gon' need a doctor  Get at em we hit 'em up if they rattin'
Niggas ain't fuckin' with the boy them niggas softer than satin
I'm feeling awful and aggy, yes I walk with the maggy
I tell him park in a alley, and leave 'em parked in the alley
Niggas talking about me, but they ain't talking it at me
Cause if they talkin' it at me, then I'm just talking to caskets
All that talking is pussy bitch you better make ya words strong
Cause the shit gettin' chiseled on ya tombstone
What they do I got a chopper in the UHaul
Make a real nigga bring it back to '92 dog
Bring his ass to the river drop the fool off
Hope he can swim with them concrete shoes on
I got the gun right beside me who don't
Got beef homie I was just getting hungry
When you come bitch you better bring an army
We can do it in the streets and throw a gansgta party nigga  Thirty shots in the clip, nigga let's trip
Line 'em up, put 'em down on the guest list
These niggas 'bout to make me go Rambo
I'mma take the shit as far as it can go
War is the answer if ya questioning the general
Snap shots at you baby you are just a centerfold
And less Kenny Cole, niggas seem plenty bold
Pull that bitch out alright don't make me get my fishin' pole
Them niggas hoes, really doe
I would swing down there with any O, Forty-Fo' and let 'em go
Let 'em know, that I ain't never been sweet and won't be
Yes I'll be right here on the ground when you want me
Make a nigga have to come back like Rufus Mack
Thomas bitch I promise I'll kill ya and that's a fact
And I ain't never killed no one, Jack
But I'm honest bitch I promise I'll kill ya and that's a fact  
Jumping off the front porch with a new approach
Don't approach me with the bullshit
I remote to a location where the broom sit
Here I go street sweeper Monday through Friday
If not go we can catch a fade, catch a fade, catch a fade
Catch a fade, catch a fade, catch a fade, catch a fade Pulling up and hopping out
Shell, catch it poppin' out
And I ain't never been a Tom or a Jerry
Pussy or a Rat, pussy on my nutsack
Carry plenty Kenny tats, give me that, give me plenty fetti
Federales on my back, pack them in the cemetery
Send a scary hit out on your messenger
I'm ignorant to wrestle a gorilla in the center of an Acura Integra
I'm pissed off, so I piss off rooftops
Drinking through a straw, fuck a rent-a-cop
I'm hot, I'm napalm when the beat slap like eight palms
And I wear eight charms, every airport alarm
Go off till they tackle me, what I do wrong?
Nigga it ain't 'bout the chain, nigga you the fucking bomb
Bomb on a bitch nigga then his bitch later
Put the tips on the bitch, nigga you a fucking waiter
I don't even want a favor, I just want a fair one
And it's like that till the sheriffs come Jumping off the front porch with a new approach
Don't approach me with the bullshit
I remote to a location where the broom sit
Here I go street sweeper Monday through Friday
If not go we can catch a fade, catch a fade, catch a fade
Catch a fade, catch a fade, catch a fade, catch a fade Droop-E, look
Problems we solve them, 'bout that action
One less sucker nigga, that's subtraction
His boss is, factors on the team
Real niggas, no actors on the team
Not you, who Droop? He a good dude
Put him in a bad mood, he turn you into goon food
I'm in the party, feeling like me
S-I-C-K with TDE
Your bitch want sex and my ear like wax
And this Landy got her ready to get it hit from the back
She shows up chump, salute give daps
Get your face flat, you don't want that
Get your nose tapped, you don't want that
Get your life fucked up all over a batch
Get cropped, get chopped on your head like a barber shop
Have it out in the parking lot Jumping off the front porch with a new approach
Don't approach me with the bullshit
I remote to a location where the broom sit
Here I go street sweeper Monday through Friday
If not go we can catch a fade, catch a fade, catch a fade
Catch a fade, catch a fade, catch a fade, catch a fade Stay turned, super charged up, stoned
Ghetto pass never revoked
Mouthpiece faster than a speedboat
Keep it one hundred like a C-note, pea coat
Po-po tryna decode lingo
Not drunk but I'm finna be hella twisted
Lifted like a toilet seat, grown ass kid
My bitch always telling me, I ain't shit
She hate me, but she love my dick
Trapper factor macker having money like a rapper
Bumping local talent pulling up with the blabber
Patna wanna challenge 'cause my pockets hella fatter
But he gone be unlucky like walking under a ladder
Put hands on a man, fuck unity
Ain't nothing between us, but space and opportunity
Never been a sucker, never been a lame
Stay in your lane, you can't see me like a stealth plane Jumping off the front porch with a new approach
Don't approach me with the bullshit
I remote to a location where the broom sit
Here I go street sweeper Monday through Friday
If not go we can catch a fade, catch a fade, catch a fade
Catch a fade, catch a fade, catch a fade, catch a fade Where you from Droop-E? 
Where you from Kendrick? 
Aye 40 where you from though? 
Who bring it to their front door? 
And where they get their game from? 
And where they get their slang from? 
And where they get their strains from? 
And where they get their grapes from? 
These are my One St. Thomas flows
Me, my niggas and some Madonna hoes
That look just like virgins but trust they down to go
Discussing life and all our common goals
Smart kids that smoke weed, honor roll
Look how the champagne diamonds glow
Fine dining pour another glass when the wine is low
I'm in the crib stacking money from here to the ceiling
Whatever it is I got, it's clearly appealing
These other rappers getting that inferior feeling
I hope you feel it in your soul, spiritual healing
Take a look at yourself, the mirror's revealing
If you ain't got it, you ain't got it the theory is brilliant
People ask how music is going, I heard it pays
I just came off making two million in 30 days
Damn, I guess it does is what the message was
Sometimes I feel I be spending my money just because
With Weezy I'm just out here repping us
'til I get to shake the hand of the man that's blessing us
Yeah, I know these niggas miss the mean lyrics
Kush got the room smelling like teen spirit
I ask kindly if no one out here would bring defeat up
Until I lose, for now I'm the game's single leader
I fly private so no one tells me to bring my seat up
And book a suite where me and your favorite singer meet up
Who you like, tell me who it is
I'mma make sure that that woman is the next one on my list
I should call it a night, but fuck it I can't resist
This one is for all the niggas from my city trying to diss
Without a response from me you really fail to exist
And I love to see you fail, that feeling there is the shit
I swear, pussy nigga get your bread up
Enjoy the seat that the stewardess just forced your ass to let up
Why your scary ass looking down, pick ya head up
No one told you your disguise was the most ridiculous get-up?
With nose-plugs in now, I can smell the set-up
So you just wasting your time, you only making me better, yeah
I try to tell them don't judge me because you heard stuff
Chase N. Cash that's my brother from the Surf Club
Damn, that nigga always kept it so hood
Back when we would smoke good at the Oakwoods
And have girls fall through like coins in the couch
Now we just fucking all the bitches they warned us about
Scared for the first time, everything just clicked
What if I don't really do the numbers they predict?
Considering the fact that I'm the one that they just picked
To write a chapter in history, this shit has got me sick
But if I really do it don't expect to get a split
Cause this truly is some shit I don't expect for y'all to get
I'm nervous but I'mma kill it cause they 'bout to let the realest team in
Throwing up in the huddle nigga, Willie Beamen
But still throwing touchdown passes
In tortoise frame glasses, hopin' that someone catch it
People say that old Drake, we startin' to miss it
But they need to be a little more specific
Is this what y'all want? In my best Chris Tucker impression
Ducking your questions, fuck your suggestions
Money gets all of my love and affection
Cars all black like the cover of Essence
I'm allergic to coming in second but I never sneeze
Y.M.O.E. nigga, yeah Uh, yeah, this what yall want
Octobers Very Own
Young Money
ATF

Yo, Nasir Bin Olu Dara Visqu Allah
Fist full of dollars in a dice game God
D&G glasses, cloth Kangols, guided by angel with white wings
Nas the Viking, fresh to my ankles, thankful
Gangster see gangster do, I'm Langston Hughes predecessor
Gun on my dresser slang I use upset college professor
More knowledge than Webster dictionary, obituary column plus sign 'em
The first fake rapper murdered for rhyming
The jig is up, gut 'em like fish, Swiss cheese 'em up
My wrist is freezing up sick of these ducks on my hiatus
Poking out their chest like they tall as sky scrapers
But they small as a shanty in a African village
Soft as cotton candy we assassins and killers
Let shottie off in club floors, pellets spray your familia
You screaming like you love war Everybody's crazy
And somebody's gon' get shot, get robbed, get done, get stomped, get dropped
Ladies love thugs and my thugs love hip hop
Thugs love ladies and ladies they love hip hop
But everybody's crazy
And somebody's gon' get shot, get robbed, get done, get stomped, get dropped
Ladies love thugs and my thugs love hip hop Peace, fuck you with a fist in your ass
You pussy with yeast, you shook of the streets, you a Sisqó fag
You know blood baths I makes 'em, fake thugs I hate 'em
8 slug I'm bustin' no discussion or waiting
'Cause now instead of coke rhymes it's laying
No analog it's digital criminals turned rapper times is changing
Niggas get flashier houses more plusher
Bitches giving ass up at ages more younger
Hands on the clock keep turning, hands on a Glock they keep squeezing
Bullets stop in your sternum they stop you from breathing
I'm light year far, your mouth get all white
When I'm near you I frighten your heart
I want you to watch me notice stare look closely
Feel I'm who you 'posed to be real I know it hurts you
Soldiers approach you, you want to squash it, you older than most dudes
Although Nas did you and your whole crew, but Everybody's crazy

Ladies love thugs and my thugs love hip hop
Thugs love ladies and ladies they love hip hop
But everybody's crazy
And somebody's gon' get shot, get robbed, get done, get stomped, get drop
Ladies love thugs and my thugs love hip hop Peace, I know where niggas sleep; it's too many schemes too many plots
War cost money and man I got too many spots
Hungry niggas get tutored to thinking new shit to come up
Killers fuck with killers you sleeping you getting stuck up
Not me, you're not ready I'm low but I be watching
We all connected so your man know my man
Your man knows my fam' they was cool when they was locked up
Beat cases and now niggas back on the block, what
Bothers is taking secret routes when they drive
Tinted windows ears to the street stay on their job
Peep niggas that got prices on their head so high
Their main niggas'll take the contract, surprise
So we play a mental game, intimidation
Got pussy niggas getting pressed up on and paying
I wish these niggas would step up wait for the day and
Since I'm famous they thinking assault rifles won't be spraying
Who ever thinking coming to my vault or the safe
I got some niggas with acid, get it thrown in your face
Play dirty catch your moms in J-30

This is as far as it goes
This the end of the road
This the end of the rope
The other end at her throat
It's suicidal she wrote
This is the end of the show, it's over
We doin' drugs 'til we in a coma We don't love these hoes, our hearts got colder
It's hard out here for a lonely stoner
I know I'm doin' drugs, but so what?
Just pray to God I never throw up
I pray to God my plug I pour up
I pray to God my plug still show up
I know the last time, we tried to rob him
He lucky, bro'nem ain't fucking off him
I'm drinking, driving in the Bentley coupe
So it's hard for me to drive, I move too slow
I told you, baby, I ain't saving no hoe
I only save the money, antihero
I burned my old clothes and got some new clothes
I left my old hoes and got some new hoes
My brother got a chopper and it's kickin' like judo
He shootin' while I'm drivin' the two-door This is as far as it goes
This the end of the road
This the end of the rope
The other end of the throat
It's suicidal she wrote
This is the end of the show, it's over

We doin' drugs 'til we in a coma I'm smokin' dope 'til I'm in a coma
The moon rock on me, I love the aroma
I get so high that I'm in the clouds with the fallen angels
Demons with halos
She love the coke, but not Coca-Cola
But she'll still pop it like a soda for ya
Her name rings bells like a Motorola
I lay the bitch off like I'm her employer
And she gon' ride like a roller coaster
And I'm gon' hide when the love is over
But it's far from over, losing composure
In a coffin, laying stiff like a boulder This is as far as it goes
This the end of the road
This the end of the rope
The other end of the throat
It's suicidal she wrote
This is the end of the show, it's over
We doin' drugs 'til we in a coma
This is as far as it goes
This the end of the road
This the end of the rope
The other end at her throat
It's suicidal she wrote
This is the end of the show, it's over
We doin' drugs 'til we in a coma

But, love, you know these hoes be makin' me weak
Y'all know how it goes, B, so I stay deep What up, boo? Just keep me laced in the illest snakes
Bank rolls and shit, back rubs in the french tubs
Mackin' this bitch, wifey nigga
So when you flip that coke
Remember the days you was dead broke
But now you style and I raised you, basically made you
Into a don, flippin' weight, heroin and shit
You know the pussy is all that
That's why I get baguettes, 5 carats and all that
From Dolce Gabana to H Bendel, I'm ringin' bells
So who the player? I still keep you in the illest gators
Tailor-made so we can lay up in the shade reminiscin'
On how I fuck the best and shit
Especially when I'm sippin' Baileys
Don't give a fuck about how you move with them other mamis
I push the Z, eatin' shrimp scampi with rocks larger than life
Fuck them Reebok broads, you made it known who your wife was
I got you frontin' in Armani sweaters
Before this rap shit, when you was in leathers and bullshit Berettas
And E classes with Mo in the glasses
Shows in Cali with all the flavor suede Bally's
Now all your mens is up in your Benz's
High post, I swear you be killin' me, playin' inside my pubic hairs
I never worry about them other chicks
'Cause you proved who was your wiz
When you was spendin' that bitch
I took a little when you was up north, your commissary stay pilin'
How you livin' large on the island?
All them collects have me vexed, but when you come home
Knew I was comin' off with half of them checks
Now we on the rise
Your diamond mami with the slanted eyes
Holdin' this grip, cocked the En Glee-Kay and shit
Fucks no, I see half of that dough
Made you into a star, pushin' hundred-thousand-dollar cars Ain't no nigga like the one I got

Sleeps around but he gives me a lot

Friends'll tell me I should leave you alone
​​​Hah hah, hah hah, hah hah, hah hah​​​

Man of their own, man of their own)
Ready for it
I'm ready for it
Yeah, ahh Eastside nigga with the feets high
Nigga with that Lisa, uh
Talkin' about that Lisa, nigga, with that Westside, nigga
With that Eastside, that dance, uh Your eyes speak the truth when everything else lies

Bruh, I survived readin' guys like you
I'm surprised y'all think you can disguise y'all truths

You can be a hairpin off and you can trigger your roots
I wave to these haters, don't give me dap
You know the world can see just how phony you act, bruh
Y'all body language is all remedial
How could you see the difference between you and I?
My crash course was much tougher
'Round friends who kill they friends
Then hug their friends' mothers
And show up at the funeral, complete with blank stares
Invisible ink, I had to read things that wasn't there
Memories may sneak down my cheek
But I could see a side-eye in my sleep Ready for it, deep breath, fill up the void
Eyes open them up, check off the coins
Still stingin' from tears, they try to see you
I'm ready for earth, ready for real
Solipsistic, admit it, I see you there
So it seems, so you seem
I can't tell if you're image or are just the flare
In my dreams, in my dreams I sat down with Prince, eye to eye
He told me his wishes before he died
Now, Londell McMillan, he must be color blind
They only see green from them purple eyes
They eyes hide, they eyes high
My eyes wide shut to all the lies
These industry niggas, they always been fishy
But ain't no Biggie, no lazy eye, huh
This guy had 'Slave' on his face
You think he wanted the masters with his masters?
You greedy bastards sold tickets to walk through his house
I'm surprised you ain't auction off the casket
Don't big bro me, don't Big Homie
I've seen pure admiration become rivals
I've been to Paris at least two times
I've seen the Eiffel, I've seen a eyeful Ready for it, deep breath, fill up the void
Eyes open them up, check off the coins
Still stingin' from tears, they try to see you
I'm ready for earth, ready for real
Solipsistic, admit it, I see you there
So it seems, so you seem
I can't tell if you're image or are just the flare
In my dreams, in my dreams I've been out of touch for a couple years
I've been ready for this for real
Hopin' I can touch what I see
'Cause I've been ready for you, for real Look, you've done enough
Have you no sense of decency, sir?
At long last, have you left no sense of decency?

I fell into the pit and it's bottomless
There goes my soul, but it isn't my property
Try and take it from me, demonic robbery

Oh I keep you fresher than the next chick
No need for you to ever sweat the next chick
With speed, I make the best chick see the exit indeed
You gotta know you're thoroughly respected by me
You get the keys to the Lexus, no driver
You got your own 2001 to ride in
And keep your ass tight up in Versace, that's why
You gotta watch your friends you got to watch me
They conniving, shit, the first chance to crack the bank
They try me, all they get is 50 cent franks
And papayas, from the village to the telly
Time to kill it on your belly no question
Have more chicks between my sheets than Essence
They say sex is a weapon, so when I shoot
Meet your death in less than 8 seconds
Still pounding in my after life
Laughing, my thing is tight
Let me hear y'all Ain't no nigga like the one I got

Sleeps around but he gives me a lot

Friends will tell me I should leave you alone
​​​Hah hah, hah hah,​​
Tell the freaks to find a man of their own
Man of their own, man of their own
Lights on, I see your face
She eat me up, she got expensive taste
I see you dreaming, but you still awake
Big slices, that's how you cut the cake
It's cold as hell, I show and tell
Weezy home, our nigga out of jail!
In this give or take world I got what it takes
Put you out your misery: Kathy Bates
I'm Young Money, I'm Cash Money
If we could buy time I'd spend my last money
Now I'm spending time, you in the blind
This little light of mine, I'mma let it shine
Bright lights, night lights, headlights, shh
No lights but them infrared lights
Long life, don't like to ask twice
You killing me baby, this the past life 
Turn up the lights in here, baby
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this
Turn up the lights in here, baby
You know what I need
Want you to see everything
Want you to see all of the lights Ready, set, go, go, go, go, go
Go til you can't go no more
I'm ill times ill, dope plus dope
Westside bitch, quote, unquote
Woah there boy, don't go there ho
If you cross that line I might overload
I swear these lights be talking to me
But I can't read Morse Code
Why every rapper named Big got bodied, huh?
But every rapper named Sean got money, ooh?
Well I guess my chances are 50/50
But my vision is 20/20 so I be counting a hundred 100's
Oh my Allah, Lordy lordy lordy, I took your chick
Now you want beef and I am chuckling like I'm Porky
Cause you spend all day with her spooning
I spend all night with her forking
There's a one-way ticket to Hell and
They want these bullets to book it for me
I'm shitting on every statistic that said I'd be dead or fuckin broke
This is history, your kids' kids' kids' kids' kids gonna book report me
And I think they want to murder me
I'm shining hard, because bitch I'm an emergency 
Turn up the lights in here, baby
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this
Turn up the lights in here, baby
You know what I need
Want you to see everything
Want you to see all of the lights So good, so good, Westside, so hood

I just stepped out of the strip club, made 5000 look like 50
I spend all my time in Houston, smoke that kush but I don't do Whitney
I don't do Britney, I don't do Lindsay
I made $2 million since last Wednesday
And I hate y'all! Y'all got too much free time
Saying I don't drop shit, everything gon be fine
Worrying about your old girl, trying to see if she's mine
Nigga she's with me when she tells you she needs some me time
It's our time, so fuck y'all!
I'm really about to go Spring Break now
And start taking shots in this muthafucka
And you didn't have all that ass last month girl
What, you get some shots in this muthafucka?
Yeah, we got the Roc in this muthafucka
You thought niggas going pop in this muthafucka?
Young Money, power, respect in this bitch
You would think we got the LOX in this muthafucka
I made mistakes, I made some bread
I even made a way for them to get ahead
To my surprise, nobody replacing me
Take Care and Carter IV it won't be long 'til they can see the lights
And I'm on one, I got one
You a pussy nigga, I'm not one, so call it a night, call it a night
And I run this, and y'all know that
I take the purple and pour that, all in the Sprite, all in the Sprite
Can you be? 
Can you be? 
Can you be? 
Can you be? 
Will you be? 
Can you be? 
Can you be? 
Can you be? 
Can you be? 
Can you be? 
Can you be? 
Can you be? 
Can you be? 
Can you be? 
Can you be? 
Can you be? 
Can you be?  I got that gold stuff stuck on my back
I got that now I can't get that back
Now a fawner, no matter where I'm at
So mad, I'm so glad I've got her back Can you be? 
Can you be? 
Can you be? 
Can you be?  Get off me, get off me
Get off me, get off me
Get off me, get off me
Get off me, get off me
Get off- I caught a wave
Caught more air than Super Dave
Call Aaliyah, I'm super paid
Jet lag, and tryna recuperate
Just got off the flight from Budapest
Don't need Khaled, to say you the best!
You the type of nigga to shop at Uniqlo
Just found out my father-in-law unisex
Running out of money, running into debt
Running from bill collectors, I ain't pay them yet
Shit you did, with no matter how rich you get
And even more, depending on the bitch you get
I be getting worried for my niggas getting married, seriously Can you be? 
Can you be? 
Can you be? 
Can you be?  I got that gold stuff stuck on my back
I got that now I can't get that back
Now a fawner, no matter where I'm at
So mad, I'm so glad I've got her back
I take a sip of Hennessy and then get pissy drunk
I ain't a drinker, I'm a thinker, call it what you want
But if you turn your back, know that you just missed your chance
To witness the realest shit that's ever been told to man
I found myself losing focus at a Sunday service
Embarrassed so I start questioning God, What is my purpose?
He said to live the way he did, that's all he want from me
Spread the word and witness, he rose on the first Sunday
I said alright, enthused that my Lord gave a listen
I opened my Bible in search to be a better Christian
And this from a person that never believed in religion
But shit, my life is so fucked up, man; I can't help but give in
I'm giving testimonies to strangers I never met
Hopped on the pulpit and told them how I was truly blessed
Felt like I'm free from all my sins when the service was over
Walked out the church, then got a call that my homie was murdered
Then lost my faith again What am I gonna do
Gotta have faith
Life is too much
I'm just through
Where is your faith?

Faith
All you need is the size of a mustard seed Single black parent from Compton raising children of 4
That's 4 innocent bastards cause Papa, they don't know
Her day consists of working back and forth with babysitters
Can't find no one to watch her kids, so she pay her sister
Her baby daddy ain't 'bout shit, that nigga ain't 'bout shit
Spilt his daughter milk just to cop a new outfit
She pray to God every night hoping that he'll mature
And maybe one day his kids, something that he'll live for
Baby wanna go back to school but she need some help
Because it's hard trying to pay the bills when you're by yourself
She thought about credit card scams, 'til she heard a voice
That said, The Devil is a lie, make a better choice.
And so it's back to McDonald's and every month dealing
With those crazy ass people at the county building
Looked to the heavens and asked Him to make a better way
Then got a letter in the mail, lost her Section 8
Then lost her faith again What am I gonna do
Gotta have faith
Life is too much
I'm just through
Where is your faith?

Faith
All you need is the size of a mustard seed I had dreams of holding a 9 milla to Ray's killa
Ask him why as my eyes fill up
Each day it gets more realer, orangutans bang like gorillas
It's jungle when the niggas in zoo
The rats lurking, vultures circling the serpents
Cats lying through they teeth, my nigga didn't deserve it
I flirted with the ideal of caressing the steel
To make karma come faster than she normally will
It's ill, to see my faith try and leave me
It's so hard to get it, to get rid of it is easy
I'm tryna reach Cloud 9, that's what my niggas 'bout
But it never rain in California unless the pistols out
Until then, my feet planted on the ground
Shadowboxing my conscience till my faith start responding
And if I get no answer, just know I tried
I should have never looked into his son's eyes
Rayshawn Boyce What am I gonna do
Gotta have faith
Life is too much
I'm just through
Where is your faith?

Faith
All you need is the size of a mustard seed This for my people that stressing whenever times is hard
Your mind's slipping, wondering, Is there really a God?
Knowing you shouldn't think that way and trying to freeze your brain
But whenever there's pain, that feeling forever remains
We can't believe what we can't see and reality seems stronger than prayer
Cause you tried to change your life, and now you live in a wheelchair
And your son was born with cancer and he live in urgent care
At the tender age of 12, and you feel that no one cares
Searching for answers, that's human nature, you ain't in the wrong
Just know when you feeling that way His Spirit's in the room
I watched people I know pray and catch the Holy Ghost
And wonder why I ain't ever caught that feeling before
Maybe they know Him better, or I don't know no better
But what I do know, is that He's real and He lives forever
So the next time you feel like your world's about to end
I hope you studied because He's testing your faith again I'd rather not live like there isn't a God
Than die and find out there really is
Think about it
Nickels and dimes, kilos and nines
Can't stop the flow when all we know is crime Talk broken english and drug selling I got the formula to success: get yourself
A kilo from Bobbito, then get yourself a couple of peoples
And we can make this work, never let them niggas try to jerk
If they do, put them in the dirt then murk
Now, get your property some place to harbor these
Get yourself a couple of shorties that shoot a Glock with ease
And let's start clocking G's, never let Bobbito sell you flour
Take a  now it's time to flip 'em like Micky D's
Take your baking soda and your triple beam
Not too much soda, gotta keep it potent enough to cripple fiends
And keep 'em running, coming back; keep your gun in lap
In case these niggas try to steal your crack, there'll be none of that
Just lock it down like Comstock nothing better
Don't ever sell a tray on my block you'll need the doc-
-Tor, move fast to have a empty case
When you start seeing dough get that fire proof sentry safe Hustling 101 welcome to the class
You'll learn the art of dealing history and making broken English your math
I can't teach you how to stash, see myself I hold cash
Every dollar like its my last, 'cause it might be
I stay away from hoochies that love Gucci's and Louis
Vuitton - the Don, before I spend: do me
Before the sun rose we was out chasing dollars
With a couple of O's that follow downing bottles of rosé
And we celebrating living life 'cause Hell can wait
First it was capsules, now its fish scales and selling weight
What about rapping, rappers always be asking, What?
While you was on promo tour I was at home laughing
Stashing, staying in fashion, putting cash in
The fireproof sentry safe if we die for loot Slacking in the game, can't make it happen
Cop some cracks and put yourself back on the map and
Once your clientele's grooving without you nothing's moving
You got that shit they want, need, gotta have when they're using
This shit is deeper than the streets, we're working for the government
Before they try to Larry Davis me we're going public
Can't see my future from the street so I live for now
Gotta get legit before they hear my name too much downtown
Tryna be up out this shit soon as I start packing
Every time I try to leave this game it pull me back in
A magnet to selling small white crack mints
Think bags of it 'cause I never had shit
I gotta get mine regardless even if it means
Putting my ass on the line like a trapeze artist
I gotta blow, watch for the smoke
That's all I know so that's all I wrote 
Young, young nigga but I'm bummin' like a double OG

Sending packages in the mail prepared to post bail
To catch me they going put a hussla under the jail

Tired of the silique. Trigger squeez!
And please...if being broke is a disease, I took a test amd passed then nigga I'm clean
From methazine poured in a two-litre
Got my gorillas with me and I'm the zoo keeper
See you ain't seen it all until you seen it all
If life a like a movie, you never know when it night pause
Pause. Uh 
This is a 101 percent music exclusive
*scratched samples*
E-40—40 playa partna
Hiero-glyphics
Ah yeah
40...40...Hiero
Heavy on the Grind Entergamement
Ah yeah
40...40...Ah yeah... {E-40]
Ugh, put me with the greats; don’t put me with the fakes
Me and the 'glyphics go back like vinyl and cassette tapes
No female traits just OG boss shit
It ain't gotta to be on the radio to be a hit
I told this broad the other day 'Bitch, what do you want?
Wanna hear some solid motherfuckers or some chumps?'
She said 'Water, water, I swear on my daughter
You the best that ever done it—I put that on my mama!'
Hit you other the head like a quarter creche
I mean every fuckin' thing I say
Hella rhymes done got away, but still relevant to this day
Born and raised in the Valley J
Hooking up with my folks from the O-A-K
Rockin' the mic 'til I’m old and gray
What you niggas gotta say? BIATCH! Average niggas talk about other niggas' business
Great minds talk about ideas and dimensions
I feel we the difference—E-40, Hieroglyphics
You speak on the Bay, the aforementioned
Coming up before you even finished half your sentence
Ask, you bitches, if your ass suspicious
We the masters spittin', take out half your district
Interact with wizards or in pools with rap magicians Barnum and Bailey, the show goes on
You better get it on before the whole ozone gone
I got a jones in my bones for a spliff and riff and a semi tone
Until you see me sitting on my throne, I’ll be on my grind
Pep Lava go hard or go home
When the mic is on, and the light gets shown
It’s Hieroglyphics crew and Vallejo's own and on Yeah, we love our style, 'cause we underground
But the funds pile, plus the guns go blaow
And we thug hoes out
And always slidin' up the block with some thunderous pound
We just some Town veterans
Rep it with no extra effort 'cause we never left it
But still worldwide accepted
Name a continent where I ain't respected
Hop on Fonzie shit, start firing my weapon  E, E, E, E, E, E, E, E-40
Hiero, Hieroglyphics
Heavy on the Grind, grind, grind, grind
E, E-40
Hieroglyphics...E-40...Hieroglyphics That’s right—rap gods My crew rocks all in the boondocks
2Pac all in the boombox
Two Glocks, bankrolls in the shoebox
You with them stank hoes? You need a new bop
I’m in my Hiero hoodie, Hiero jeans on
Looking like you wouldn't swing on King Kong
Yep, gettin' my Joe Clark Lean On
Nouveau—Hiero and 4-O Y'all frosty, parfait softy
Fresh off the charter plane or the chopper with the laundry Operation Dr. J, dock of the Bay
Your style scrawny, act salty, bag off me, rap saucy, ask 40
Laboratory all foggy
Auditory got your paparazzi shorty soggy, call Doggy
Satellite walkie talkie, you side higher than the hierarchy
I'm Mani Marley off the kamikaze Gotta watch me, zoom like a Maserati
Do 'em like I rock the party, this is not a hobby
Off the Rossi, giant in the game
True slang on 'em and they claim it like it's you, come anew It’s A-Plus, the A stands for alien
Different kind of cat, no category you could say he in
Hieroglyphics and E-40, A-P off the chain again
I be on one, people they say I’m mainey, mayne
I be one merry elf—Molly, she got a very soft body
Try to kick it like me, you will be carried off probably
Been wildin' at parties since I was barely off the potty
While your fairy ass partnas be tryna scare off all the hotties There is no competition 
No comp, no comp, no competition 
There is no competition
No comp, no comp, no competition
Go getter, with no cheddar
Just a white tee and a swap meet sweater
My life is likely to see great endeavors
But I can't win if I can't get it together
What I gotta do in order to see success?
Having the world's best to call me the best?
Pull up at the Grammy awards as the best dressed
With an address linked to a beautiful actress?
A dollar and a dream, I feel J. Cole
Word to the hole in my pocket and the hoes
That don't wanna fuck with a broke nigga with ambition
But the last time I checked, y'all was broke bitches
Make a name for myself then bubble like the ass of Buffy
When she wearing a tight belt
The homies on the block can say whatever they say
I don't wanna be a killer, I wanna be a Gates In time, it'll come
Just stay focused and humble, my son
Show and prove, prove you're the one
It's not about who is dopest
Who wants it the most
So just go out and get it
Go out and get it
Go out and get it
Go out and get it What I gotta do in order to see success?
Having the world's best to call me the best
Pull up at the Grammy awards as best dressed
With an address next to a beautiful actress
Do I gotta run in your spot and start blastin'
Better yet, rob the nearest Nix Check Cashing
Ear hustle on a nigga that's constantly braggin'
Catch him at the light, snatch him out his Jeep wagon
Or maybe I gotta hook up with Jose
Cop 5 bricks of the yay, head to the Bay
Area or carry the birds to VA
Let the Clipse distribute the work all day
Then come back home
Every three weeks flip three to six zones
Homies on the block can say whatever they want
I don't wanna be a dealer, I wanna be a trump
Donald that is In time, it'll come
Just stay focused and humble, my son
Show and prove, prove you're the one
It's not about who is dopest
Who wants it the most
So just go out and get it
(And when I do I do it again
Then I go back
When I do I do it again
Then I go back
Thug it out)
Go out and get it
(But for now I'mma go head and doug it out
I gotta rhyme, rhyme)
Go out and get it
Go out and get it So welcome to the story of my life
See I'm tryna get to get right off the shit that I write
Make a fortune, buy some Porsches for my momma and my wife
Pops engine in this old school run tiiight!
But as you listening to K-D-O-T
Man, me and my girl split the bucket of KFC
She listening to Drake and all I can say is Damn
These niggas that much better than me, baby?
I don't think this is meant to be
Cause I'm always losing self esteem
She paused the iPhone then said, Huh?
I repeated what I said then she replied, Shut up.
You know you the best boy, you gotta keep doing it
But don't forget when you do, just keep you in it
And never listen to what the industry say
Don't be a typical artist, be more like Jay
Russell, Barry Gordy, Quincy Jones, Bob Johnson, Sean Combs, L.A. Reid
Young black entrepreneurs did what it took to succeed, yeah
So I gotta see success, I gotta make it off them Rosecrans steps
Rising to the top like a soda shook up
Bout to pop, and I'll pop on whoever's in my way Go out and get it
Go out and get it
That's jazzy right there
Yeah, oh, hold up, oh
Bring it back, bring it back *record spins back*

But you have to understand this, man, that we are a cursed people Deuteronomy 28:28 says, The Lord shall smite thee with madness And blindness, and astonishment of heart
See, family, that's why you feel like you feel
Like you got a chip on your shoulder
Until you finally get the memo, you gonna feel that way Why God, why God do I gotta suffer?
Pain in my heart carry burdens full of struggle
Why God, why God do I gotta bleed?
Every stone thrown at you restin' at my feet
Why God, why God do I gotta suffer?
Earth is no more, won’t you burn this muh’fucka?

That homework better be finished, I beat yo' ass
Your teachers better not be bitchin' 'bout you in class
That pizza better not be wasted, you eat it all

Seven years old, think you run this house by yourself?
Nigga, you gon' fear me if you don't fear no one else If I could smoke fear away, I'd roll that mothafucka up
And then I'd take two puffs
I'm high now 
I'm high now 
Life's a bitch, pull them panties to the side now

I don't think I could find a way to make it on this earth I'll prolly die anonymous, I'll prolly die with promises
I'll prolly die walkin' back home from the candy house
I'll prolly die because these colors are standin' out
I'll prolly die because I ain't know Demarcus was snitchin'
I'll prolly die at these house parties, fuckin' with bitches
I'll prolly die from witnesses leavin' me falsed accused
I'll prolly die from thinkin' that me and your hood was cool
Or maybe die from pressin' the line, actin' too extra
Or maybe die because these smokers are more than desperate
I'll prolly die from one of these bats and blue badges
Body-slammed on black and white paint, my bones snappin'
Or maybe die from panic or die from bein' too lax
Or die from waitin' on it, die 'cause I'm movin' too fast
I'll prolly die tryna buy weed at the apartments
I'll prolly die tryna defuse two homies arguin'
I'll prolly die 'cause that's what you do when you're 17
All worries in a hurry, I wish I controlled things If I could smoke fear away, I'd roll that mothafucka up
And then I'd take two puffs

I'm high now 
I'm high now 
Life's a bitch, pull them panties to the side now

Now When I was 27, I grew accustomed to more fear
Accumulated 10 times over throughout the years
My newfound life made all of me magnified
How many accolades do I need to block denial?
The shock value of my success put bolts in me
All this money, is God playin' a joke on me?
Is it for the moment, and will he see me as Job?
Take it from me and leave me worse than I was before?
At 27, my biggest fear was losin' it all
Scared to spend money, had me sleepin' from hall to hall
Scared to go back to Section 8 with my mama stressin'
30 shows a month and I still won't buy me no Lexus
What is an advisor? Somebody that's holdin' my checks
Just to fuck me over and put my finances in debt?
I read a case about Rihanna's accountant and wondered
How did the Bad Girl feel when she looked at them numbers?
The type of shit'll make me flip out and just kill somethin'
Drill somethin', get ill and fill ratchets with a lil' somethin'
I practiced runnin' from fear, guess I had some good luck
At 27 years old, my biggest fear was bein' judged
How they look at me reflect on myself, my family, my city
What they say 'bout me reveal if my reputation would miss me
What they see from me would trickle down generations in time
What they hear from me would make 'em highlight my simplest lines I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' creativity
I'm talkin' fear, fear of missin' out on you and me
I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' loyalty from pride
'Cause my DNA won't let me involve in the light of God
I'm talkin' fear, fear that my humbleness is gone
I'm talkin' fear, fear that love ain't livin' here no more
I'm talkin' fear, fear that it's wickedness or weakness
Fear, whatever it is, both is distinctive
Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth
And I can't take these feelings with me, so hopefully they disperse
Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax
Searchin' for resolutions until somebody get back
Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth
And I can't take these feelings with me, so hopefully they disperse
Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax
Wonderin' if I'm livin' through fear or livin' through rap
Damn God damn you, God damn me
God damn us, God damn we
God damn us all Verse 2 says, You only have I known of all the families of the Earth, therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities.
So until we come back to these commandments
Until you come back to these commandments
We gonna feel this way, we gonna be under this curse
Because He said He's gonna punish us
The so-called Blacks, Hispanics, and Native American Indians
Are the true children of Israel
We are the Israelites, according to the Bible
The children of Israel
He's gonna punish us for our iniquities, for our disobedience
Because we chose to follow other gods
That man chasten his son, so the Lord, thy God, chasten thee
So, just like you chasten your own son, He's gonna chastise you
Because He loves you, so that's why we get chastised
That's why we're in the position that we're in
Until we come back to these laws, statutes, and commandments
And do what the Lord says, these curses is gonna be upon us
We gonna be at a lower state in this life that we live
Here, in today, in the United States of America
I love you, family, and I pray for you
God bless you
ShalomNiggas, get your milla genuine draft, cause its milla time, we about to go hard on these hoes on

One more time, one more time
Uh, one more time
Uh, one more time I dream of the day I can go back to when I was born
Layin' in your arms, wishin' you was here today, Mom
Wish you'd appear, just for a second from Heaven
My tears would be gone, I wouldn't be rappin' this song
I'd be happy drivin' up to your eight-bedroom mansion
Up late, laughin' about the hard times we faced
The galaxy is so enchantin' beyond, Galileo's understandin'
Past the Milky Way and all the planets
There's somethin' out there greater, but only God knows
Scientists claim we came from apes, but they lies though
That was part of our conversation
I spark one up and start blazin'
Thinkin' of how amazin' she was, an angel gave me love
I'm thankful to ever know a woman so real
I pray, when I marry, my wife'll have one of your skills
But Mom, you could never be replaced
I'd give my life up just to see you one more day, to have— One more dance with you, Momma
If I could only have
One more dance with you, Momma
Praying, wishing that I could have
One more dance with you, Momma
If I could only have
One more dance with you, Momma I wish you were here, I miss you more each second I breathe
You resting in peace, forever, I accepted you free
A blessing to me, I see you dressed in all white
Smilin' at me, happy, knowin' everything's all right
If only I could hear your voice and your laughter
Just one more time, my chest would be filled up with sunshine
April 7th '02, that's when the gates of Heaven opened up
For you to stroll through, beautiful Anne Jones
Job is done, raising ghetto kids in the hood
You was my strength to carry on, and now I'm good
Job well done, you lived through your sons and grandchildren
Jesus finally got his bride, Mommy, dance with him!
And you've been my guide through all the trouble I faced
They playin' our song, the life-beat, my hand on your waist
I grab your other hand, I'm tryin' not to step on your toes
Spin you around with my eyes closed, dreaming I can have— One more dance with you, Momma
If I could only have
One more dance with you, Momma
Praying, wishing that I could have
One more dance with you, Momma
If I could only have
One more dance with you, Momma I love you forever, Mom
You will always live through me, always
Uh, uh, uh, yeahGood evening ladies and gentlemen
{*scratched*: Let's describe a certain female} Bitches will be bitches as I smash in the Chevy
It's gettin, it's gettin, it's gettin kind of heavy
Bitches will be bitches as I smash in the Chevy
It's gettin, it's gettin, it's gettin kind of heavy
Bitches will be bitches as I smash in the Chevy
It's gettin, it's gettin, it's gettin kind of heavy It all goes back, to '85
When I start gettin pussy every day of my life
It really didn't matter what the bitch look like
I remember one night, after the Sugar Ray fight
Wouldn't you believe it, Dogg like a retriever
I went up in this big fat bitch named Treva
She had a best friend with titties named Vanessa
She told me to undress her, yessir
Ain't no pressure, later that semester
She put me down with her homegirl name Tanisha
She was so vicious, lips so luscious
Suck a nigga dick and have it shinin like some dishes
Patricia, Patricia, she love the way I stick her
I take her to the movies and now, she eat the dick up
Big bucks, no whammies
I had to meet this white bitch, her name was Tammy
She lived in the Valley, she couldn't understand me
But she let me dig out, her homegirl named Brandi
Now Brandi was a cute little thick bitch
She moved to the hood from the 2-0-6
She brought some new tricks, flippin them squirrels
And the pearls, and turnin out the neighborhood little girls
Hmm, and I seen that, so I peep the game
So I put her down, bottom bitch on my team
And we began makin, breakin bitches takin
Whatever we want, see she want with the fakin
It's real in the field, no mistakin
And crack the little bitch, yeah she Jamaican
Time and time again she would bring me bud
And let me beat it up, listenin to One Love
Off some jerk chicken, I got mo' bitches
Now I'm fuckin her sister it's gettin real suspicious
But the dick is good, so they won't tell
And now they next door neighbor, Clarissa Bell
She been lookin at me, I think she wanna hit
But I'mma holla back, cause I'm on another bitch
I'm on some other shit, I got a phone call
From the motherfuckin president y'all
He said, Snoop Dogg, how could I fuck a bitch
And make her suck a dick and not get caught for the fuck of it?
I called and look here, this what you do
Make the First Lady sell a little pussy for you
I think he got it, cause he left fast
He left his daughters, and a lot of cash
Well what do ya know, D-O-double-G
Major pimpin, out in D.C
And I'm a young pimp, got a lot of growin left
And you's a young ho with a lot of hoein left
Always keep a ho in check, blowin us a train wreck
Yeah I might have to go in depth
See every little ho I met
They're standouts, you know the ones like Yvette
We fucked in the car, behind a bar
I shot it in her face and it went Ahhh

Went up in his sister, behind the garage

When y'all was tryin to hump, I was teachin them to suck dick
Always tryin to go up in a ho
Got caught tryin to fuck in school they asked me what I did it fo'
You know just what I told her?
I love pussy, and this dick is what I showed her
And now they threw me out, now I'm at the pad

It's what I say and do to make the bitch give it up
Oh you wanna brag? I wanna brag too
Now what you gon' do, when they ask you
Is you gon' tell a lie, or you gon' keep it G
Or you gon' hold it all inside or you gon' tell on me?

A one-on-one, you must have won
Every pageant in America when you was young Lips, hips, hair drips down her back

The only girl that can make time

Where's she from? No I.D. 
And if I die before I wake, I pray that I'm in outer space

I show her off, I stunt with her
We do it sweet, they look bitter
Look at her get up, I hear 'em say
But why him? I hear 'em hate
I laugh at it rather than jab at it
Then continue eternal life as a crack addict
Cause I'm addicted, and you the drug
Cold turkey? No sir
You gotta be an Odyssey from heaven and above
You definitely know, probably I gotta give it up Lips, hips, hair drips down her back

The only girl that can make time
Then make me, stop... She looks better than Beyonce, Alicia Keys, Halle Berry, Miss Jolie
Where's she from? No I.D. 
And if I die before I wake, I pray that I'm in outer space

Can't be too, wide open, there's nothing, I won't do
Oh, just thought you should know That's when you start to laugh
Saying I just want what I can't have
Won't even give me a chance
Claiming I'm just not as serious as you
Shorty if you only knew, this is serious I wish I, wasn't famous
I wish I, was still in school
So that I could have you in my dorm room
I would put it on you, crazy That's when you start to laugh
Saying I just want what I can't have
Won't even give me a chance
Claiming I'm just not as serious as you
Shorty if you only knew, this is serious Up all night
Up all night
Up all night
Up all night
Up all night
Up all night
Up all nightThey call me Eight Shows H.O
You can stunt like that when you own the whole place, though
This is Rich Porter, part two
You can stunt like that when you’re rich before your debut
Money and the murder, rapper or the trapper
Either way I’m gonna serve ya
Shooters on my team... No really, I got shooters on my team
Juan or Deron
How you niggas want it, pick a arm
They call me Lucky Lefty...
Ball so hard I don’t respect the fuckin’ referees
Ain't nobody prayin' for me


Ain't nobody prayin' for me

Ain't nobody prayin' for me

 I feel like a chip on my shoulders
I feel like I'm losin' my focus
I feel like I'm losin' my patience
I feel like my thoughts in the basement
Feel like, I feel like you're miseducated
Feel like I don't wanna be bothered
I feel like you may be the problem
I feel like it ain't no tomorrow, fuck the world
The world is endin', I'm done pretendin'
And fuck you if you get offended
I feel like friends been overrated
I feel like the family been fakin'
I feel like the feelings are changin'
Feel like my thought of compromise is jaded
Feel like you wanna scrutinize how I made it
Feel like I ain't feelin' you all
Feel like removin' myself, no feelings involved
I feel for you, I've been in the field for you
It's real for you, right? Shit, I feel like— Ain't nobody prayin' for me
Ain't nobody prayin' for me
Ain't nobody prayin' for me
Ain't nobody prayin' I feel niggas been out of pocket
I feel niggas tappin' they pockets
I feel like debatin' on who the greatest can stop it
I am legend, I feel like all of y'all is peasants
I feel like all of y'all is desperate
I feel like all it take is a second to feel like
Mike Jordan whenever holdin' a real mic
I ain't feelin' your presence
Feel like I'ma learn you a lesson
Feel like only me and the music though
I feel like your feelin' ain't mutual
I feel like the enemy you should know
Feel like the feelin' of no hope
The feelin' of bad dope
A quarter ounce manipulated from soap
The feelin', the feelin' of false freedom
I'll force-feed 'em the poison that fill 'em up in the prison
I feel like it's just me
Look, I feel like I can't breathe
Look, I feel like I can't sleep
Look, I feel heartless, often off this
Feelin' of fallin', of fallin' apart with
Darkest hours, lost it
Fillin' the void of bein' employed with ballin'
Streets is talkin', fill in the blanks with coffins
Fill up the banks with dollars
Fill up the graves with fathers
Fill up the babies with bullshit
Internet blogs and pulpit, fill 'em with gossip
I feel like this gotta be the feelin' where 'Pac was
The feelin' of an apocalypse happenin'
But nothin' is awkward, the feelin' won't prosper
The feelin' is toxic, I feel like I'm boxin' demons
Monsters, false prophets schemin'
Sponsors, industry promises
Niggas, bitches, honkies, crackers, Compton
Church, religion, token blacks in bondage
Lawsuit visits, subpoena served in concert
Fuck your feelings, I mean this for imposters
I can feel it, the phoenix sure to watch us
I can feel it, the dream is more than process
I can put a regime that forms a Loch Ness
I can feel it, the scream that haunts our logic
I feel like say somethin', I feel like take somethin'
I feel like skatin' off, I feel like waitin' for 'em
Maybe it's too late for 'em
I feel like the whole world want me to pray for 'em
But who the fuck prayin' for me? Ain't nobody prayin' for me
Who prayin' for me?
Ain't nobody prayin'
Money machine at the bank, I just made me a deposit
Fucked that bitch right on the sink
Is it the pussy or is it the faucet?
I just left the hotel, never let ho in mi casa
All this designer shit it's like a crib in my closet
I got a crib in my closet, got a crib in my closet
Man, all this fuckin' gear it's like a crib in my closet
My Nike shoebox filled with rubber bands
That mean my Nike shoebox is my ATM
Fuck it, I said it, I'm winning, downsouth MC Ren
I might buy some Timbs, or peanut butter MCM
Raised down the street from a crack house
Pull her hair weave 'til the track out
Treat the rap game like a trap game
Tryna make a yellow ho tap out
I got Dolce, I ain't even worn yet, codeine I ain't even po' yet
I could spend millions of dollars, and still won't even be poor yet
Yeah, I'm a motherfucking poet, riding now, motherfucker Ol'Nat
A nigga wearing a Versace shirt, man that's a motherfucking throwback I got a crib in my closet, got a crib in my closet
All designer shit, I got a crib in my closet

Or mishappens, matching turned to swagging
He exposed the world to trappin'
Picture posin' tactics
Hold this that click click, finna' blow this backwards
Money, hoes and fabrics
Scrolling past like ''fuck yo photo caption''
If ye ain't got it then you bragging, that's automatic
I see no need for me to Tweet, these bitches know my status
I'm the shit, all designer shit, got all kinds of shit
Got Prada around from 1999 and shit, bet you won't find the shit
I’m on my Anna shit, that’s Wintour
It’s dressed like it’s Met Ball

Got a crib in my closet, Spanish chick in my casa
So much space in my closet, fit your crib in my closet I got a crib in my closet, got a crib in my closet
All designer shit, I got a crib in my closet

Second row at the fight, bitch get on my level
Larry Merchant my nigga, I got Holyfield money
Finger your girl at Coachella, gotta roll in that for me
You should see me in Lennox, I shop ‘til I drop

What's your life about? Enlighten me
Is you gon' live on your knees or die on your feet?
S'Fire in the street, fire in my Swisher
Fire in between the two legs of your little sister
Just get a sip of this elixir, before they crop us out of the picture
I've never seen a crop circle but I've seen cops circle the block
I puff squares, but I swear one day I'ma stop, my nerves itch
On the brink of my career while my peers struggle for employment
Can you hear these screams?
 One, two
Three four grams and a fifth of Hennessey
A bad bitch, fuck the penitentiary
Section 80's babies, blame Ronald Reagan, we raising hell
Lord forbid, the homie got wet, so we trying to soak it in
The president is black, but you can't vote for skin
You vote for the better man
Come to our show, you can see the diversity
Unify the people, they gon' peep it universally
We might not change the world
But we gon' manipulate it, I hope you participatin'
Ayo Dot, won't you let these cats know?
We knew we'd be here, like back in 04'
Started HiiiPower because our generation needed a generator
In a system meant to disintegrate us
And all we do is assist them
We're not victors, we're victims
The bigger picture isn't developed yet
Like what if Keisha was celibate?
Or what if Tammy came across a real man
Who didn't play games like children?
My nigga cheated on his girlfriend
With his girlfriend's girlfriend, let the world end
And everybody tripping off 2012
And the extraterrestrial presence as well
 But our future is not
That Martial law shit dropped, we gon' all get got
So keep that question mark on your face
Eat your fast food, use your fluoride toothpaste
Hide your feelings from the public
Work a little nine to five, don't forget to pay your tithes
And to thank God you're alive
HiiiPower
And on another note
We focused like the Hubble Telescope
Soul! Life is a traffic jam, life is a traffic jam
Life is a traffic jam, life is a traffic jam
Life is a traffic jam, life is a traffic jam
Life is a traffic jam, life is a traffic jam
Life is a traffic jam I wrote this because I was ordered to
People say I speak for generation Y
Why lie, I do, Section 80
Your son will play me if the radio won't
Daughters that just turn one to twenty one listen to Kendrick
For instance
What's your life about? Enlighten me
Is you gon' live on your knees or die on your feet?
Take out that student loan, and pay off your college degree
And do exactly what you see on TV
True story, hmm
Can you repeat that for me, Soul?
What's your life about? Enlighten me
Is you gon' live on your knees or die on your feet?
Is you gon' plead the fifth or sound the horn?
The time is now my child, come on
See a lot of y'all don't understand Kendrick Lamar
Because you wonder how I could talk about money, hoes, clothes
God and history all in the same sentence
You know what all the things have in common?
Only half of the truth, if you tell it
See I spent twenty-three years on the earth searching for answers
'Til one day I realized I had to come up with my own
I'm not on the outside looking in
I'm not on the inside looking out
I'm in the dead fucking center, looking around
You ever seen a newborn baby kill a grown man?
That's an analogy for the way the world make me react
My innocence been dead
So the next time I talk about money, hoes, clothes
God and history all in the same sentence
Just know I meant it, and you felt it
'Cause you too are searching for answers
I'm not the next pop star, I'm not the next socially aware rapper
I am a human mothafuckin' being over dope ass instrumentation
Kendrick Lamar!
Now fuck 'em up Terrace!
 I watch this fire that we’re gathered around
And see that it burns similar to the fire that’s inside you
Section.80
Section.80 babies
A generation of bliss and disobedience
Know they can't control us
Know they can't control you
Know they can't control us
But we can control each other
We build our own world
If you don't leave with nothing else tonight, you will leave with knowing yourself
You will leave knowing that you represent something thats bigger than all of us
Our family
Heart, honor and respect
This is you, this is me
And we are HiiiPower 
Uhh, uhh, uhh
You ready, B?
Let's go get 'em Look for me!
Young, B, cruisin' down the Westside Highway
Doin' what we like to do, our way
Eyes behind shades
This necklace the reason all of my dates been blind dates
But today I got my thoroughest girl with me
I'm mashin' the gas, she's grabbin' the wheel, it's trippy
How hard she rides with me, the new Bobby and Whitney
Only time we don't speak is during Sex and the City
She gets Carrie fever, but soon as the show's over
She's right back to being my soldier
‘Cause mami's a rider and I'm a roller
Put us together, how they gon' stop both us?
Whatever she lacks I'm right over her shoulder
When I'm off track, mami is keepin' me focused
So let's lock this down like it's supposed to be
The '03 Bonnie and Clyde: Hov' and B All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend 
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend 
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend 
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend  The problem is, you dudes treat the one that you lovin'
With the same respect that you treat the one that you humpin'
That ain't 'bout nothin'
If ever you mad about somethin'
It won't be that, oh no, it won't be that
I don't be at places where we comfy at
With no be-atch, oh no, you won't see that
And no, I ain't perfect
Nobody walkin' this earth's surface is
But girlfriend, work with the kid
I keep you workin' that Hermès Birkin bag
Manolo Blahnik Timbs, Aviator lens
600 drops, Mercedes Benz
The only time you wear Burberry to swim
And I don't have to worry, only worry is him
She do anything necessary for him
And I do anything necessary for her
So don't let the necessary occur, yep! All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend 
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend 
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend 
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend  If I was your girlfriend
I'll be there for you, if somebody hurts you
Even if that somebody was me 
Yeah-hee 
Sometimes I trip on how happy we could be
And so I put this on my life
Nobody or nothing will ever come between us
And I promise I'll give my life
My love and my trust if you was my boyfriend 
Put this on my life
The air that I breathe in, all that I believe in
I promise I'll give my life
And all of my trust if you was my boyfriend All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend 
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend 
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend 
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend Bootleggers, bombing, Bin Laden
I'm still crackin'
I will not lose, I simply refuse
I dropped the same date as the Twin Towers
I show power
Still I show compassion for others, sent money and flowers
Devote hours
I live in the struggle, I'm addicted to the hustle
I'm conflicted because, dude
America, this land of mine
Is filled with prisoners, with the same plans as mine
So I'm a walking contradiction
On one hand I love my position
But easily I could have been in that prison
And no, I am not a Christian, though I believe in God
But I don't believe in the devil, my beliefs are odd
If we the people was given freewill from God
How could He give the people freewill, without giving you E-vil?
We will hold it together, believe in the Roc
Long after you leave the spot
Long after my breathing stops
My spirit remains vibrant, I will lead the flock
And that's the tip of the iceberg
You might hear Christ's words in my scriptures
But I only write it for my niggas
Whenever I'm down and out I get back to myself
I roll a motherfucking fat bat to myself
Leave it to beaver, America gon' legalize but I ain't believe her
Til she finally did it
Overworked but I'm still committed
All things under the letter G, Snoop Dogg done did it
Gracefully gazing unto the sky
A lot of people smoke just to get by
But I see things much differently
Medically, physically, mentally, theoretically
Put it in a letter so you let it be
One day we'll all agree and have peace up under a big chronic tree
If I had my way at 4:20 every day you could blaze a J
And not have to answer to nobody
I live my life like it's a party
So let's go cuz So go ahead and blaze up
Today's the day to blaze up 
So go ahead and put your J's up 
Na-na-na-na-na-nanana 
Na-na-na-na-na-nananana I blaze up soon as I raise up from out of my sleep
I got me a sweet
I hope they legalize it here, I'm tired of police
You think you could smoke like me & Snoop, don't try to compete
I'll still blaze with ya, fire that ho up
If smoking weed is going down, then I'ma show up
Weed is where I'm needed, it's a necessity
If I ain't got it, little shit get the best of me
I even put it in my food, I got a brownie recipe
You eat one piece man your ass'll be fucked up for six or seven hours or so
You don't like edibles? Then I got plenty of flowers to blow
Smoke it in the paper, cigar, a bong
Don't worry about the haters, just vibe to the song
And do it however you please, you please
Today's the day to smoke weed So go ahead and blaze up
Today's the day to blaze up 
So go ahead and put your J's up 
Na-na-na-na-na-nanana 
Na-na-na-na-na-nanana Damn, a pound ain't really nothing now
Remember smoking with my cousin
Now we all Raw cone stuffing
Enough to wake neighbors up
KK my favorite flavor
And you ain't gotta ask cause we major
I smoke like them old players
Only put it in the paper
I just started recently letting niggas smoke blunts around me
Known to keep the room cloudy
Get a bad bitch, sit her down, let her smoke, now she open
The best trees I be smoking
Smell it through the bag so it's potent
Even get it on the plane, TSA don't even notice
Ran in the burner, he done taught a young nigga how to grow it
A pothead but I be focused
And it ain't in my session if it's bullshit
Only the best what you dealing with
It's legal now, everybody's doing this So go ahead and blaze up
Today's the day to blaze up 
So go ahead and put your J's up 
Na-na-na-na-na-nanana 
Na-na-na-na-na-nanana
Go ahead and blaze up
Today's the day to blaze up
So go ahead and put your J's up
Na-na-na-na-na-nanana
Na-na-na-na-na-nanana na Come and smoke with me tonight, tonight Diamonds are forever
They're all I need to please me
They can't stimulate or tease me
They won't leave in the night
Have no fear that they might desert me 
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever forever forever
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme
(Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever ever?
Ever ever? Ever ever? Ever ever? Ever ever?) Good mornin', this ain't Vietnam still
People lose hands, legs, arms, for real
Little was known of Sierra Leone
And how it connect to the diamonds we own
When I speak of diamonds in this song
I ain't talkin' about the ones that be glowin'
I'm talkin' about Roc-a-Fella, my home
My chain, these ain't conflict diamonds
Is they, Jacob? Don't lie to me, man
See, a part of me sayin' keep shinin'
How when I know what a blood diamond is?
Though it's thousands of miles away
Sierra Leone connects to what we go through today
Over here it's a drug trade, we die from drugs
Over there they die from what we buy from drugs
The diamonds, the chains, the bracelets, the charmses
I thought my Jesus piece was so harmless
'Til I seen a picture of a shorty armless
And here's the conflict
It's in a black person soul to rock that gold
Spend your whole life tryin' to get that ice
On a Polo rugby, it looks so nice
How can somethin' so wrong make me feel so right?
Right? 'Fore I beat myself up like Ike
You can still throw your Roc-a-Fella diamond tonight 
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever forever forever
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme
(Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever ever?
Ever ever? Ever ever? Ever ever? Ever ever?) People askin' me is I'm gon' give my chain back
That'll be the same day I give the game back
You know the next question, dawg, Yo, where Dame at?
This track the Indian dance that bring our rain back
What's up with you and Jay, man? Are y'all okay, man? Yup, I got it from here, 'Ye, damn
The chain remains, the gang is intact
The name is mine, I'll take blame for that
The pressure's on, but guess who ain't gonna crack?
Ha ha, pardon me, I had to laugh at that
How could you falter when you're the Rock of Gibraltar?
I had to get off the boat so I could walk on water
This ain't no tall order, this is nothin' to me
Difficult takes a day, impossible takes a week
I do this in my sleep
I sold kilos of coke, I'm guessin' I can sell CD's
I'm not a businessman; I'm a business, man!
Let me handle my business, damn
Kanyeez you got me, Freeway then Foxy
YG's, Teairra Mari, Peedi watch me
Bleek could be one hit away his whole career
As long as I'm alive he's a millionaire
And even if I die he's in my will somewhere
So he could just kick back and chill somewhere
Oh yeah, he don't even have to write rhymes
The Dynasty like my money: last three lifetimes
Shirley Bassey's in the rear
Sayin' exactly what I've been sayin' practically my whole career
The diamond is forever, I've been minin' this forever
Now the Louis Vuitton Don's timin' couldn't be better
People lined up to see the Titanic sinkin'
Instead we rose up from the ash like a phoenix
If you're waitin' for the end of the Dynasty sign
It would seem like forever is a mighty long time
 Good night!

Only go backwards, lately
Every part of me says go ahead
I got my hopes up again, oh no, not again
Feels like we only go backwards darling And we'll be screamin' out no rules, no rules
Feel the energy we go through, I told you
Pump my fist like I'm supposed to, I showed you
My vision of the unsocial, it's so cool
Look around me and you'll see the scene, who to blame?
See my generation has no shame, I play the game
How I see it this is inside the future, this is nothin' that you're used to
I refuse to play the victim, my religion is to move ya
Out your power position, my army head-on collision
Can't harm me out of my own skin, government need assistance
Every time that I zone in, nothing is more convincin'
Than tellin' you that I won't bend, break or fake partition
I can't, this is my life design, this is me taking mine's
This is what I live for, this is me takin' yours
This is more than C4, this is what happens when
We ready to build and destroy, I hope that you enjoy It feels like I only go backwards, lately
Every part of me says go ahead
I got my hopes up again, oh no, not again
Feels like we only go backwards darling I live my life a rebel, a vigilante, devils try to get at me
Pedal through this underworld, undertakers won't catch me
System ain't no system for justice if you would ask me
I'll tell you everything is corrupted, don't you walk past me
With the condescended look I can tell you're pretendin'
Like you my friends and you just a henchman, I feel relentless
I feel the tension in the air thick enough to cut through it
Or cut you with it, I'm cut from a cloth that bred a nuisance
Trespass on your property I am properly aimin' to go against ya democracy
This is me changing faces cause I can stand alone and die alone as long as I got pride
The victory of fight is all in my eyes
The night is young and I can see your demise, I'm waitin' for it
You can’t ignore it, you live dormant, I die enormous
Big as the lies you tell I can tell you feel defeated
The truth will set you free and to me that's the only reason, capisce? It feels like I only go backwards, lately
Every part of me says go ahead
I got my hopes up again, oh no, not again
Feels like we only go backwards darling
It feels Greetings loved ones

And I can take it back for y'all
Like the old '77 Cadillac with walls
I be peepin' in the back, Maybach for y'all
Weezy dope like crack dissolve
Ain't no cases round here gettin' cracked or solved
Cause ain't no boys around here 'bout to crack at all
Baby girl, what's really good? I'm trynna crack that off
Leave your man where he at, and ain't a Mac get off
Man, I got the dreads in the rubberband swingin' in the air
Got this thing in my other hand, ain't bangin' in the air, naw
And I ain't singin' this for help
I mean what I say, and say what I felt
I lean cause the K heavy weight on my left
Yao Ming couldn't block these shots himself
GuddaCHORUS :
I'm a man I gotta take care of my family
Fighting these pressures in my life
I know my mind should be on shining and getting grammies
But these streets won't say goodbye I can't say goodbye
To the blocks
Goodbye
To the hood
Goodbye
To the streets 
Charlie: I can't say goodbye
To the hood
Goodbye
To the blocks
Goodbye
To the streets
I can't say goodbye
To the blocks
Goodbye
To the streets
Goodbye
To the hood
I can't say goodbye
To the hood
Goodbye
To the blocks
Goodbye
To the homies VERSE :
I guess it's true, you can't take the hood out a homeboy
Plus, my hood just lost another homeboy
Another one got life, and we don't know, if he coming home boy
They in the street tell me just leave it alone boy
Let them do them take care of your own boy
But I said back brake a bound, before I was grown boy
You had dreams of being a dope boy
Yeah, I was runnin' from the po po
Banging for the turf, late night huntin'
Puttin' me in work, good day comin', airbrush, shirt
Pay day, got the spot, got my hair cut first
Made mom sick when I wouldn't go to church
Yeah I live in the burbs, but I think 21st
I know since I left that it's gotten much worse
But I'd still be there, if I couldn't write a verse CHORUS :
I'm a man I gotta take care of my family
Fighting these pressures in my life
I know my mind should be on shining and getting grammies
But these streets won't say a goodbye VERSE :
To the blocks that raise me, the enemies and the homies that made
Me, tough enough to hang on the corners that would mould me
Critics wonder if I'm tryna be the old me
But if they think the old me ever left, then they don't really know me
And don't know, we don't change, we just become OG, you always addicted
To the life, you just don't OD, shit I owe the streets before they owe me
Took me in when my momma didn't want me, to wild to be a child, and pops
Not around now, all I got now is the homies, to teach me, how to be a man
In what not, how to brake ounces in the grams in what not
The reason I'm so nice with my hands in what not shit, you think I forgot, man naw CHORUS :
I'm a man I gotta take care of my family
Fighting these pressures in my life
I know my mind should be on shining and getting grammies
But these streets won't say goodbye VERSE :
Thank god every day that the boy could spit
And all around the world they enjoyin' my shit
I know I got plenty more wars to get
I got a, beautiful wife and some gorgeous kids
But it wouldn't be right if I ignore the shit
They made me how I am, the music in the man
Told me that I can for the world gave a damn
If it wasn't for my niggas sayin' stick to the plan
Probably be a gun instead of a pen in my hand
Probably be doin' a dub and the pen with my man
The say leaders streets but they don't really understand
All I had was the block, when I didn't have fans
Rapped on the corners when I couldn't get spins
All I had was the homies when I didn't have kids
If it all come down and my career was to end, I'm sure my name
Would live.. in these streets CHORUS :
I'm a man I gotta take care of my family
Fighting these pressures in my life
I know my mind should be on shining and getting grammies
But these streets won't say goodbye I just can't say goodbye I can't say goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
I can't say goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
I can't say goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
I can't say goodbye You can take the man out the streets
But you can't take the streets out the manIt's your boy Kanye Cheddar and I'm 'bout to sell 
How much he charge for a track? About 
How many niggas bit the soul? 'Bout 
How many girls did I bone? About 
I freestyle battle niggas for 
Hey yo, y'all niggas don't want it
It's  ways to die in this city
Hear me?  Look, listen A lot of speculation about the money I've made, me and Just Blaze
How are they fo'real, are them niggas really paid?
Rappers I've met or dealt with direct
Is it true he won't send a beat tape until he get a check?
What's the position you hold?
Can he really master depths who check by check
And 'H to the IZZO' only single that went gold?
If Roc-a-Fella should fold and you're left out in the cold
Is it back to ghost producin' for D.Dot on the low?
For the millionth time, askin' me
Questions like Toni Braxton, harassin' me
Like you don't care about my son's feelin's
Can I get a minute, you whack 
I ain't gotta jack shit
You heard 'Takeover', who runnin' this rap shit?
Eww fake tits
Shut up and make hits
Can't we all just get along, spread love like Take Six
What'chu doin' in L.A. with 50 Cent and Dr. Dre?
Didn't one them niggas have beef with Jay?
We doin' this shit for entertainment
Brings guns to the arraignment
While the judge in the chamber let one up out the chamber
BLAOW! {*laughs*} I'm gonna sell 
And after that I'ma buy a couple buildin's
My dog He Nice named his son 
Uh, oh, y'all know what it is
Uh, it's that Compton -ish Chevy lights, women you like
Husslin' nights, 
Rollin' dice, gangsta rights
Hood advice, 
Chevy lights, women you like
Husslin' nights, 
Rollin' dice, gangsta rights
Hood advice,  I'm back at it again
My city back at it with ‘em
Back against the wall, K Dot, they tryna pin
But they can fuck with that pen
The shit I write is brighter than blue gems
You better stay in that gym
Exercise your mind till it's strong enough
To fuck with mine
Stick to my roots like Black Thought and 'em
I'm black with thoughts of Einstein
One word describing him, genius
What you know about the city I'm living
With the souls of the dead is livin'
You don't know about our living conditions
We live righteously, we can give a fuck about your opinion
But it's more than just weed and women, gangsters, husslers
Bullet collisions, players , pimps
Who can envision the place where I reside
Where Eazy was pitchin', Dre was 6'4 lifting
NWA had mention, Quik had the turn tables mixin'
The first ones to say fuck the system
I'm tryin to tell you about Chevy lights, women you like
Husslin' nights, homie that's Compton life
Rollin' dice, gangsta rights
Hood advice, homie that's Compton life
Chevy lights, women you like
Husslin' nights, homie that's Compton life
Rollin' dice, gangsta rights
Hood advice, homie that's Compton life Geah, his own street like concrete
Would best describe fit his gutter
But see I'm what's underneath
A young gun but not like your young Chris and Neef
I'm from the land of organized crime
Disorderly peace
‘Cause nowadays niggas hustle when they order their piece
And worship their gun the same as their religious beliefs
The Compton shares can't forget the police
‘Cause in the hood tellin pigs no more
It be the mark of the beast
And their main aim is just the talk of the streets
But when you see ‘em please be quick on your feet
That they go , watch em!?
Had you for road kill just like a possum
You could contain ‘em
But there's no way that you can stop ‘em
Niggas plant their seeds to be gangstas
Hoping one day they blossom
The same time, hope the system don't lock ‘em
‘Cause Compton raised niggas and bitches we barely got ‘em
Unless you talk about the one with the attitude problem
From Rosecrans to Central, Compton Centennial
We back that's for my people it's official Chevy lights, women you like
Husslin' nights, homie that's Compton life
Rollin' dice, gangsta rights
Hood advice, homie that's Compton life
Chevy lights, women you like
Husslin' nights, homie that's Compton life
Rollin' dice, gangsta rights
Hood advice, homie that's Compton life I don't know if he new around here
Ye it's good to know somebody if you're new around here
‘Cause it ain't too safe for you to cruise around here
Niggas stick to your ass like glue around here
Take New Jersey and fit it shit whatever you don't care
It ain't no magic trick if they make your shit disappear
The outcome is severe, and some of this casket will last a day
But I'm amazed cause the young boy been here for years
I seen niggas shed blood blood tears
Hope you not try to plan for the future niggas will mute you
Had your door in the morning wake you up like roosters
Introduce you to rugers
Clock you in like Tap Judah
A nightmare on my street, Fred Krueger where I live
Minus the actress and the producers
Even adolenscence will shoot you over that paper
We get +Vapors+ like Biz Markie but still I'm used to
From Rose crest to central, Compton's Anthemia
We back that's for my people it's official Chevy lights, women you like
Husslin' nights, homie that's Compton life
Rollin' dice, gangsta rights
Hood advice, homie that's Compton life
Chevy lights, women you like
Husslin' nights, homie that's Compton life
Rollin' dice, gangsta rights
Hood advice, homie that's Compton life
Never thought I'd be talkin' from this perspective
But, I'm not really sure what else you expected
When the higher-ups have all come together as a collective
With conspiracies to end my run and send me a message
40, did you get the message?
'Cause I just checked my phone and I didn't get it
I mean, I say hats off for a solid effort
But we didn't flinch for a second, we got our shit together
Yeah, not here to fight wars
But niggas wanna talk high scores
PARTY just dipped off in a white Porsche
And I just came from dinner where I ate some well-done seared scallops that were to die for
But, I got bigger fish to fry
I'm talkin' bigger shit than you and I
Kids are losin' lives, got me scared of losin' mine
And if I hold my tongue about it, I get crucified
Wrote this shit on a bumpy flight on a summer night
Flyin' over Chattanooga
Out here tryna spread the movement
I just got me the Mercedes Pullman
You niggas never heard of it, you gotta hit up Google
Back in the city, shit is gettin' brutal
These kids'll hit your noodle then take a girl to the movies
They've been droppin' out on both sides
We ain't in it, we just ghost ride
The pen is workin' if you niggas need some ghost lines
I thought you wanted yours like I want mine
I guess you just makin' moves on your own time
But just know it'll be January in no time
And your absence is very concernin'
It's like you went on vacation with no plan of returnin'
Shit is purely for sport, I need a 30 for 30
Banners are ready in case we need to retire your jersey
I got a club in the Raptors arena
Championships, celebrations durin' regular seasons
Paternity testin' for women that I never slept with
I'm legally obligated if they request it
So much legal action like I'm Michael Jackson
Luckily, I'm great at avoidin' distraction
Used to give no reaction, now I'm overreacting
Ahh nigga, that shit gotta go platinum
I just listened to Closer to My Dreams
Wide eyed and uneducated at 19
I can't rap like that, all young and naive
Not after all of the shit I've seen and the things I believe
Drastically changin', thank you for all your patience
I'm just in a different space and I choose to embrace it
4,000 square feet just isn't as spacious
You loved me back in the basement
Guess it is what we make it
I'm tired of awkward exchanges and niggas' crooked ways
Tired of champagne toasts with people that look away
Peyton and Eli when niggas called me they brother
The season start and I don't wanna
See you end up with nothin'
Y'all throw the word family around too much in discussion
Rookie season, I would've never thought this was comin'
They knees give out and they passing to you all of a sudden
Now you the one gettin' buckets
They put their arm around you
Now you becomin' the crutches
Kids got on your number cause you the one they look up to
And women that you seen on TV look better in person
And either they wanna fuck you or convince you
That they care to see where it goes from there
But these ain't the girls from Brampton
This ain't that local action
The haters just bringin' me and my people closer, actually
What happened to the things
You niggas said was supposed to happen?
Are we just supposed to
Ignore the fact that it never happened?
We just supposed to get the pie and then split it in two?
Supposed to forget your mistakes, but not forget about you?
My plan was always to make the product jump off the shelf
And treat the money like secrets, keep that shit to ourselves
Papi champú, young pablito de seis dios
6 G-O-D, I think I was destined for this shit
When I was 'round Keyshia Cole and T.I
And Young Dro was poppin' off with Ain't I
Way before niggas had they hands out
Like they doin' macarena
But, who am I to complain now, I'm still around, they know
I ain't like these broke bitches
I ain't like these broke bitches

I'm gettin' money
I ain't like these broke bitches
I ain't like these broke bitches
I'm gettin' money
Biatch, broke broke biatch
Biatch, broke broke biatch
Niggas in the city hating me man they tripping
When I'm the only one that's really spitting
My nigga Lil Lee the only one that's really gripping
Why you dap me up acting like like we cool if you don't feel him nigga?
Uh, I'm bringing back hip hop
Me and my nigga Drake
VA, Toronto, Hip-Hop Aiight let me take my jacket off
Unlace the Timbs, here again comes the jabberjaw
This time I'm blabbing on
These rappers that feel a certain way but they give me dap and all
Mad cuz the freestyle iller than they whole catalog
I got the gift like Santa Claus
Flow got spring like a catapult
Matter fact the flow Supreme like Diana Ross
I'm at the do' like a deer with the antlers off
Niggas acting like Scummy was they nigga
Wouldn't even give my man a 12 bar feature
I know who you are cause he wanted me to eat ya
I said nah lets keep it peaceful
My nigga was a true weed source
He gave it to us for a cheap cost, at prices we all could eat off
A real street dog
The type of nigga that y'all niggas be studying learning how to get street off
We have an impostor, alert the doctor
Bout to hit him up with the chopper like Blaka
Shock em like Blanka from Street Fighter, heat got a
Hurricane kick, murder everything quick
Look, my new Ryu nine is stupendous
Why do guys choose my crew to pick wit
My crew lie you guys into ditches
I said it and meant it the Scorpio's Mind has many dimensions
I'll say it in intent, sentence, indent, on instant pimpin
Hope your listenin' to my diction
If you are then you now should be itchin'
That it's crack we placed in your stereo system
Yeah, I be at your burial trippin'
Nickelus F from Richmond, VA
The Scorpio's Mind is not a game to play wit all day I've been hated by many, wanted by plenty
Disliked by some, but confronted by none
Since they don't show me sincerity, I load up, lock up
Take shots at em I guess you could call it a parody
And compared to D
They one-fourth from watermelon to a quarter felon, dude you a pear to me
If that's not how it is it's how it appear to be
You got blind heaters, in my sweats is a mind reader
And when the psychic get to touching my palm
Seein' your physical, the things that you never say to me visible
Especially when one of your artists feeling threatened
Cause I'm harnessing a weapon, won't you pardon my reflection
Mirror, mirror tell me why they wanna get and scrimmage
And play around, to perfection I'm the spitting image
My verbal camp is vivid, I told you I'm spitting image
It seems we often want to start but never get to finish
My verbal campus is Villanova, and those of you feelin Hova
And writing college rhymes, but the thrill is over
Let me assist you like a specialist
So you can pull it back and try catch the metaphors and the rest of this
It's not a problem wit X, I guess I'm a pessimist
Which means if shit goes bad I say, I expected this
And me and Julien we never got the chance to communicate
Instead of understanding its a tune of hate
The city's mine like Oklahoma's a Sooner state
And we're gonna have to cross paths whether soon or late
So, why don't you walk up in the spot using less strut
You ain't Morris Chestnut, you lighter and less cut
And lets be honest, by now you should be your own scholar
You still a protegé, that's the reason I don't holler
You got rappers being repetitive actors
You stay ahead of the game, I'm ahead of the practice boy
Life is just like a baseball game, three strikes you're out, no doubt
Curveballs, knuckles, sliders, and heaters
You gotsta stay on your toes and keep your eyes on their dick beaters
They greet us, like they down with our leaders
But they knowin' damn well they wanna defeat us and cheat us
Hmm, weed is-
Kick back, relax, and blaze like saks back to back
Every corner that I turn and every city I'm in
Every time I set my mind to spit rhyme with my pen
I mix the gin with Hen
Penitentiary and the graveyard got my homeboys but I refuse to let 'em back me in
I come out bustin' and blastin' in a Dogg Pound fashion
Nigga, that's what's happenin'
In this game I'm on my own with my back on the wall
Right hand on my heater, left hand on my balls I'm screamin' fuck the laws
Dogg bones and paws
Drinkin' cans of 8 balls with the muthafuckin' straw
Tilted, leanin'
Hoes tryna get at a nigga, security screen 'em
We dem G's, just C's, no fleas
We beez the epitome of rap, D-O-double-G's
The biggest, the realest niggas speak on it
You got a hunnid on it? I got a bad freak on it Spent about a week on it
Season, marinate, tryna get it tight
Now I got that shit tight
Let me spit it tonight
Bust a bad bitch on sight
Skeet on her face and then I gotta catch a flight
At 8:30 in the mornin' wit' my nigga Dwight
Who got a show for a nigga?
Who got some dope for a nigga?
Since everything on cuz I guess he got a hoe for a nigga
Love it or leave it, I'll take her home and beat it
I love it when a bitch act conceited
That's when I tell her I don't need it
See I can pass it
Bitch I'm a muthafuckin' classic
Bitch don't ya know?
I put the G in the P and put the C in the rolls
But you know, 'nuff said
Pass the 40 of the oh-ee
I'm takin' it to the head Fuck the laws
Dogg bones and paws
Drinkin' cans of 8 balls with my muthafuckin' straws
Tilted, leanin'
Hoes tryna get at a nigga, security screen 'em

Your silence is drivin' me up the wall, up the wall
I cannot tell if you're duckin' calls or missin' calls
'Cause you've been so patient
I drink on the job and smoke on the job
So, I don't know how serious you take it
Can't offer much more, you've heard it before
That narrative for me isn't changin'
I wanna make you a priority
I wanna let you know there's more to me
I wanna have your faith restored in me
I'll be on my way  In the whip solo, no one's gotta know

Get the vibe right, get your mind right
It's gon' be a long night 
Put your feet in this water, don't wanna get your hair wet
We've hooked up a couple times, we ain't took it there yet
You broke up with your man and ain't been with nobody else
You like, Fuck these niggas, rather keep it to yourself
He did you wrong, he left you down bad
Now you can't trust nobody
You said, Do anything, but just don't lie to me
I said I ride for you, girl, you said you ride for me
Umm, pulled up to the show then we got ghost
And when it's after dark anything goes In the whip solo, no one's gotta know

Knockin' at your door, I don’t gotta work anymore

A Millionaire
I'm a young money millionaire, tougher than Nigerian hair
My criteria compared to your career just isn't fair
I'm a venereal disease like a menstrual bleed
Through the pencil I leak on the sheet of the tablet in my mind
Cause I don't write shit cause I ain't got time
Cause my seconds, minutes, hours go to the almighty dollar
And the almighty power of that ch-cha-cha-chopper
Sister, brother, son, daughter, father, mother-fuck a copper
Got the Maserati dancing on the bridge, pussy popping
Tell the coppers hahahaha you can't catch em, you can't stop em
I go by them goon rules
If you can't beat em then you pop em
You can't man em then you mop em
You can't stand em then you drop em
You pop 'em cause we pop 'em like Orville Redenbacher
Young Money I'm Millie in here with them Young Money millionaires
Think you really pop a wheelie in air?
Mac Milli, the Vanilli's in here, I'm a rascal, don't get whopped

I get tassel, pass you with a flow you could never put a brake on and I break on anything a nigga take on
Feel the napalm from my trey arm, straight long, throw a nigga like I'm Akon, cause I'm acorns
Where the base gone? get the base blown, let the Pistons on that chopper
Come on, cops, I'm kamikaze, drop a rock with them Obamas

Shitty on a dime, Penny on the line plenty's in me, any guinea's with 'em, bigger than a mini, and remind I'm
Illie, and it's all off G piece and a PG walk by, beep beep
With a freak, skeet, hawk out, big feet on a jeep
She caught by Weezy F, we be the best, truly to death, prove me the rest
Groupies confess, you be the ref, 'xcuse me, I left A millionaire, I'm a young money millionaire
What, 'chyall really want it? Nah, y'all don't really wanna do it
If hip hop is dead, I am the embalming fluid
And I don't care who it be, I'm steppin' to it
Notice I say 'it', cause to me, it ain't shit
Get, it?
Call me whatcha like, trick, call me on my Sidekick
Never answer when it's private, man, I hate a shy chick
Don't you hate a shy chick? I had a plate of shy chick
And she ain't shy no mo', she changed her name to My chick

It's like the beat was screamin', Murder me!
And I'm a murderer, so I murdered it

I don't O U like two vowels
But I would like for you to pay me by the hour
And I'd rather be pushing flowers
Than to be in the pen sharing showers
Tony told us this world was ours
And the Bible told us every girl was sour
Don't play in her garden and don't smell her flower
Call me Mr. Carter or Mr. Lawn Mower
Boy I got so many bitches like I'm Mike Lowrey
Even Gwen Stefani said she couldn't doubt me
Motherfucka I say life ain't shit without me
Chrome lips poking out the coupe, look like it's pouting
I do what I do and you do what you can do about it
Bitch, I can turn a crack rock into a mountain
Dare me
Don't you compare me cause there ain't nobody near me
They don't see me but they hear me
They don't feel me, but they fear me. I'm illi Man, life just ain't life without me
Hip hop just ain't hip hop without me
Young Moola, baby
When a good thing goes bad it's not the end of the world
It's just the end of a world that you had with one girl
And she's the reason it happened, but she's overreacting
And it's all because she don't want things to change We live in a generation of not being in love, and not being together
But we sure make it feel like we're together
Because we're scared to see each other with somebody else 
You should smokes with me The chronic's blowing
The chronic's blowing
The chronic's blowing
The chronic's blowing  Blowing chronic to me, it's like a tradition to me
I got the pi-doun, so sit down and listen to me

Lot of motherfuckas pulling, police shots
I'm not The One nigga you could call me The Two
Bob Marley reincarnated, pupils dilated
Emancipated, concentrated, debated, rated many times
You suprised how I made it, huh?
You hate it, huh, but you know, I ain't even trippin
I'm spliting that Swisha up, plotting on the come up
I'm living my life, and never putting my gun up
Dranking my drink, and I'mma smoke that blunt The greener the tree, the better the bud
The strength of the branch, will tell you how chronic it was
I'm - buzzing high, sliding, slippin
Gotcha listening to Snoop and now you feel like you crippin
It's all to the good, the dash is wood
You got some hoes in ya truck and now ya ready to fuck
But, they frontin and fakin, and time is waistin
She don't wanna give ya number now she hollin at Jason
Now don't get mad, just roll to the pad
And keep a G on the bitch and roll another dub bag
 light that shit, hit that bitch
Then past it to ya homie like playa, pimp 
And when you get dizzone, crack the do'
And let me get a little snizzle

Puff, puff, pass my nigga, one lizza Do you wanna smoke wit me 
Come and keep me company
Baby come and fuck with me
You should smokes with me It's the diabolical, chronical, mythological
Psychological, make a model ho, fuck a G
Pre-medical, steady slow those, ready can get it
Teacher taught it to those with mind apparatus
My status has been the baddest ever since I intro'd
I'm that nigga that brought y'all the info
On the Chucks, French braids, and endo
Big Snoop Dogg with the fog on the window
Spell ya name in it, put ya face in it
And hang with the nigga with the gang bang spinach
Drag it, blunt wrap it, or zig-zag it
Don't really matter even if it's in the package
Put it to the side, so when ya boy hit the Eastside
I'm look for the firefied cheefa
Aiyyo Pharrell, gimme that VA discount
I'm tryna bounce wit the whole ounce  Do ya, do ya, do ya, do ya, do ya

Neptunes, Star Trak

Billionaire Boys Club, DPG
Doggy Style Records, ooh wee

Watch it, watch it - Daz is comin
And there'll be no more waitin
Watch it, watch it - Kurupt is comin
And there'll be no more waitin
Watch it, watch it - Doggystyle is comin
And there'll be no more waitin
You might be shootin, inna de place
Iffa eedyot ever disrespectin, nowww.. Now follow me deep in the depths of my mind
Think how many plots blossoms to how many times
I'm sedatin my asphixiated from beginnin broke
And the bombest weed smoke that'll make a nigga choke
To my loc's way down in the Valley deep
To my homies in the Pound from L.A. and the Beach
To my bulls out in Philly, cause all they smoke is phillies
With these silly-ass bitches out for a niggas riches
Now really, will he ever slip or trip
A big shout out, to my niggas in 
I spits the vocabulary to sinks MC's like ships
With my nocturnal vibes and editorial clips
I got a click, that'll hit you like a thousand volts
The homies catchin cases robberies and assaults
It ain't my fault that my shit might hit like that
Listen and get elevated off the verbal contact When a nigga gotta strive for his he can't stop
Gotta get somewhere
Now when a nigga gotta mash for his he can't stop
Gotta get somewhere My mind-state these days make the average nigga afraid
Hurt 'em in the worst way, put it down for myself
Put 'em to rest, confess, nevertheless
Snatch 'em a cap and destroy 'em at my best
For the simple fact with contact, we the block entourage
We drop bombs and we known to calm down the savage beast
And the rest of the jungle I'll mistreat
Any MC tryin to fuck with D-A-Z
I represent it to the fullest, it could be a verbal massacre
In ninety-six, with a different approach on shit
I got the flavor, and I'm major
Busta-ass niggas can't stop us, and can't fade us
Shady-ass niggas can't stand next to ya
When the Tek connects to ya
Swift as a cheetah when I'm catchin ya
I betcha I won't let ya escape, face the real on point
They're trained to kill, beyond the violated area
When the smoke clears the area whether I'm toast or at home
I blaze the zag or the bone
Once again another zone is gone
MC's try to step they get lit and blown At the end the lights go out so before they do
I'm a L-B-C on through, stayin true
Demandin my respect, respect is what I've given
So respect is what I expect, the money got me driven
To the point of no return - so the streets I roam
Don't catch chrome to the dome of this flack black
.45 calibre Glock gat, gun, or pistol
Whistle, and watch all my homeboys come
Run, or hear the click, damn that shit that you get hit with
When we bust, I let loose
This is pre-meditated dick-up
To all the busters that jealous and hate it, but can't fade it
With they every attempt they fail,oh well
Consequences get suffered
I put pressure on sucker motherfuckers
The bill is crisp  the deal is this
I gotta plot 'em on a mash for my chips
Get in my way and get stepped on
I'm stompin, steppin, with my projectile weapon With subjects all subject to harm, when I swarm through
Who knew about the real deal I conceal?
And still, can you feel, the topic of the whole situation is trust
No ho is a must
If I bust my brain constructs to form knowledge to the max
Defeatin and deletin elevation set backs
We wax tracks and smack up MC's who compose the violence
Bringin drama, with no parental guidance
Eyes went deceived, somethin up my sleeve to intrigue
And these MC's'll be G's
Also D-P-G's and, L-B-C's when
We do the do to you so go call your crew
And who, wants to compete with Techniec
Conflict will be verbal, so watch how you speak
And what you say when I display
Sleepless acts that's bomb to ya, suffer from insomnia
And I'ma, gonna be comin for you
So please be on the lookout for the Doggystyle Crew
 It's a sucker MC barbecue cookout
Look out.. watch out now!
Ha-ha yeah, witcha bad self, watch out!
Too rich for who? Y'all just got rich again
Who grips the mic and likes to kill they friends?
I've never been the type to make amends
If shit was at a eight, we like to, we like to, we like to—
Yeah, if shit was at a eight, we like to make it ten
1da sent this in, I'm goin' up all the way
I don't like to talk when there's nothin' else left to say  Drizzy 'bout to drop, the game is in disarray
I'd tell you hear me out but we both know end of the day
Your sister is pressin' play, your trainer is pressin' play
Your wifey, your wifey, your wifey, your wifey—  I gotta breathe real deep when I catch an attitude
I got a whole nother level that I can tap into
Max said they only blessed when they attached to you
The only deadbeats is whatever beats I been rappin' to 
And the product is still the best though
It's only good in my city because I said so
Just to fit the estate man, I had to Copperfield like presto
Voilà, tada  Never a matter of could I? or should I?
Kiss my son on the forehead then kiss your ass goodbye
As luck would have it, I've settled into my role as the good guy
I guess luck is on your side
I guess luck is on your side
All sevens, no sixes, rest easy, get some shut eye
Hold on, hold up, but I— Miss makin' 'em pay
Helipad from Will Smith crib straight to the stage
Three Forum shows but I played Staples today
The neighborhood is smokey, y'all stay safe in this place  Drizzy 'bout to drop, the game is in disarray
I'd tell you hear me out but we both know end of the day
Your niggas is pressin' play, your nanny is pressin' play
Your wifey, your wifey, your wifey, your wifey—  Had to go and hit reset, now we here
I been on top for three sets of three years
I can't be around the niggas you minglin' with
I can't fly if I could sit on the wing of that shit 
I try to pay it less mind
They been keepin' tabs on me like I'm payin' next time
I think I sense a little fear from the other side
White vans parked across the street, real subtle guys  Yeah, never a matter of could I? or should I?
Kiss my mom on the forehead then kiss your ass goodbye
As luck would have it, I've settled into my role as the good guy
I guess luck is on your side
I guess luck is on your side
All sevens, no sixes, rest easy, get some shut eye
Hold on, hold up, but I— Hahaha, I can't argue with you, no! You mad!
Look at you, you mad! You big mad! Haheheh
I'm happy! Leave me alone!
I just want some money, a lot of money
I don't get paid to argue with you
No! Who is you? You ain't nobody!
You mad
I was threw in the game with a shield and a sword
Started having money, buying things I used to couldn't afford
At the beginning of my mannishness I was the mannishest
I bought a nickel-plated .45th
Falcons, Granadas, Caddies and Fairlanes
Chevy Impalas, Cutlass and Mustangs
Donkey rolls, jewelry like a pharaoh
Troop jackets, d-boy apparel
Hop, weed, speed, coke, whatever you need
Knew how to add and subtract but barely can read
No, I can't - Yes, I did - No, I didn't
Either gon' be dead or successful or imprisoned
Triple beam scale, I was flipping the goup
Hella clientele, I was getting my loot
Concrete, I ain't made of feathers
Tear shit up just like some angry protesters I come from the streets
Where they play for keeps
The strong and the weak
Gotta be concrete
I'm from the streets
Where every day they leak
Ambulance and police
Gotta be concrete He started off fast, came in last ran out of gas, but he was winning at first
What you call a person like that? A quarter horse
Entered the game and can't run a lap, a t-tortoise
That's domino talk, mayne, you mack - O-of course
You still in the game? Nah, we divorced
You make any change? No remorse
He full of shit just like a porter potty
His hustle game sloppy, triggered off on them boppies
I'm from what's right, maybe that's what's wrong
That's what I was just telling my little homie on the phone
Be a leader not a follower
If you will be a follower, follow the right leader
Stop thinking with your peter
My peter? Yeah, your dick
Why? A chick'll get you hit
Keep your eye on the sparrow
Get cornered and ambushed, they'll limit your space, your space is narrow He put his foot where his mouth is - good riddance
Gunned him down in the drive-through of Kentucky Fried Chicken
They wasn't gangbanging, but they was set-tripping
Ate him up real good, but he still living
The victim's parent's lawyer on the case for real
Try'na put the nigga that did it behind bars to make him pay they doctor's bill
But the shooter a monster, he hella feared
So ain't nobody talking, listen here
And not only that, but the victim don't want nobody saying nothing anyway
Because when he get out and get his shit together
He gon' put them niggas under the weather
When it comes to feuding and funking gotta be clever
Beef and commotion and drastic measures
From the top of my head to the bottom of my feet
I don't know about you, but I'mma stay concrete
Biatch So I'm saying, What up? What up? Nigga, you made it
So I'm saying, What up? What up? Nigga, you made it
So I'm saying, What up? What up? Nigga, you made it
So I'm saying, What up? What up? Nigga, I hate it
So I'm saying, What up? What up? Nigga, I hate it
Frustrated and I'm riding down them back streets
Making my conscience ask me
Will I survive to make it up out this hole in time?
Black boy fly, black boy fly
Black, black boy fly, black boy fly I used to be jealous of Arron Afflalo
I used to be jealous of Arron Afflalo
He was the one to follow
He was the only leader foreseeing brighter tomorrows
He would live in the gym, we was living in sorrow
Total envy of him, he made his dream become a reality
Actually making it possible to swim
His way up outta Compton with further more to accomplish
Graduate with honors, a sponsor of basketball scholars
It's 2004 and I'm watching him score thirty
Remember vividly how them victory points had hurt me
'Cause every basket was a reaction or a reminder
That we was just moving backwards
The bungalow where you find us
The art of us ditching classes, heading nowhere fast
Stick my head inside the study hall, he focused on math
Determination ambition, plus dedication and wisdom
Qualities he was given was the shit we didn't have
Dug inside of his book bag and Coach Palmer asked for his finals
He had his back like a spinal, meanwhile
We singing the same old song spinning the vinyl
Eleven graders gone wrong
He focused on the NBA, we focused on some Patron
Now watch that black boy fly Black boy fly, watch that black boy fly
Black boy fly, watch that black boy fly
Black boy fly, watch that black boy fly
Black boy... I used to be jealous of Jayceon
I used to be jealous of Jayceon Taylor when I was young
Taylor made a career out of music from writing songs
A Buick had driven past bumping him when I mowed the lawn
Money laundering hustling, homies pondering up against
Schemes to make a million even if doing you harm
War's the case and just in case you wasn't alarmed
The city had fought with firearms and many had died before dawn
It's 2004 and I'm hearing the people roar
For the name of The Game, they line in front of the store
Swap meets, selling our mixtapes, I'm like, Oh shit, wait
Don't wanna be another nigga stuck regretting mistakes
Mixed feelings was my opinion, I was defending my insecurities
Chillin' my conscience next to a villain
Compton made you believe success wasn't real
Be honest, none of us knew of a record deal
So as I peel through these lottery tickets
I see a Harley Davidson truck visit the same plaza we shopped
A tall nigga hopped out with Jordans and a white tank top
He was top of the rap game, we was the top of the block
So watch that black boy fly Black boy fly, watch that black boy fly
Black boy fly, watch that black boy fly
Black boy fly, watch that black boy fly
Black boy... My mama didn't raise me up to be jealous-hearted
Like most of the winners call it
Regardless of where you stay, hold your head and continue marching
That's what she said, but in my head I wanted to be like Jordan
Award touring the country with money from mic recording
The only way out the ghetto, you know the stereotype
Shooting hoops or live on the stereo like Top 40
And shortly, I got discouraged
Like every time I walked to the corner, had them guns bursting
Nigga, I was rehearsing in repetition the phrase
That only one in a million will ever see better days
Especially when the crime waves was bigger than tsunamis
Break your boogie boards to pieces, you just a typical homie
All these niggas facetious and they all standing beside me
They all'll buy me a chopper if any one of you try me
What am I to do when every neighborhood is an obstacle?
When two niggas making it out had never sounded logical?
Three niggas making it out? That's mission impossible
So I never believed the type of performance that I could do
I wasn't jealous cause of the talents they got
I was terrified they'd be the last black boys to fly out of Compton
Thank God...

The reflection of lights that glare
She'll be out of control like a hydroplane in plain sight I might have to stare
And that's power steering, a power trip will see my appearance
Pile of hundreds all on a prowl like vampires in the darkest dungeon
Speakers bumpin', drinks is pouring
We in the house, we paid the mortgage, tyrannosaurus
That's real big, pop my collar, pop that lid Flashin' lights, model types, vixen show me much love
Put the bottles on that ice, drink like we supposed to
Fire burning, heads is turning, all I see is energy
So eventually we'll do this 'til the sun come up 
We'll do this 'til the sun come up

Boom, boom, boomI am grateful to be able to call America my second home. Last night when I saw the video of Alton Sterling being killed it left me feeling disheartened, emotional and truly scared. I woke up this morning with a strong need to say something. It's impossible to ignore that the relationship between the black and brown communities and law enforcement remains as strained as it did decades ago. No one begins their life as a hashtag. Yet the trend of being reduced to one continues. This is real and I'm concerned. Concerned for the safety of my family, my friends, and any human being that could fall victim to this pattern. I do not know the answer. But I believe things can change for the better. Open and honest dialogue is the first step. My thoughts and prayers are with the Sterling family and any family that has lost someone to this cycle of violence. Be safe out there. More life.
La, la, la la
Wait 'til I get my money right I got 'em, Young Carter
On the A-team if it's in alphabetical order
Used to daydream about Benzes and Porches
And by 18, I had a Benz and a Porsche, ha!
I'm so used to stuntin' on y'all
So tired of ballin', excuse me if I yawn
Ha! But I know what I'm doing
Out the window of the jet, you see L.A. like a Bruin, ha
New coupe, foot to the floor
Weather man make it rain, turn sugar to snow, you know

Excuse me, was you saying something?
Uh uh, you can't tell me nothing

That'll spit the kind of shit to put the earth in a type of zone, like
To make 'em laugh or make 'em cry
Bring a life into existence or cause you to die
Now when I was a shorty and when my mom called me precious
I realized I'm outspoken and every word was infectious
I'm sayin', Mommy said God'll bless us
No matter the difficulties or how much it would stress us
I'm sayin', no matter how hard I try
To understand if I behave that I'll see God when I die, man
These words'll dawn on me, why?
Cause no one came back from death to say if it's truth or it's lies
See the point that I'm makin' is that she knew I was blessed
And comin' to life as a legend, the man of best in the flesh
I kiss my mother, countin' figures
Thinkin 'back on when I used to tell niggas, they sayin' Yeah, homie this a theme song
First I get my money right, then I get my team on
If I always pray to have gleam on
$300 jeans on, do that mean I dream wrong?
And I was high as a Learjet
Fly as the insect, even though we in debt
And it don't matter if I get her number
Cause when I get my money right she gon' come running
And I'll be good like God with an extra O
God knows that my check needs some extra 0's
And you know that you need to bring some extra hoes
Not in jogging pants either, tell them wear some sexy clothes
Now my game so professional
And my chain so fresh, they go 
Right after the fame did you gain anything?
Damn Ye, would you change anything?
But 
I'd cop more pink polos and pop those collars
Misery love company, her nickname Sorrow

Hop on the MB5 days
Mopeds, Pro Keds, city split five ways
How it all started, fifth floor apartment
A jigsaw puzzle aerial view of the projects
A kid saw struggle, buried a few of his partners
Now I chill in resorts, enjoying massages
Check out the oracle bred from city housing
Nas, I arise the dead by thousands
I remember seeing Shan chilling near his Audi 
Hollis had Run and them but I proudly
Put a poster up of Shan and Marley, that was art kid

Pac left me inside a rap world with niggas that wink
At other rappers, undercover niggas spit every way
Won't be surprised if all their rides have federal plates
Let alone their wardrobes and Studio 4 flow
It was real when I appeared, it would've been some jaws broke
Nas, my real name, stage name, same thing
How could you let these lames claim king, I'm so ashamed, man
I light a L for Vernon for niggas who would burn in Hell for Vernon
10th Street, 12th Street, Nightmare on Elm Street
Pimps creep, delve deep inside the editorials
Of the ghetto queens, kings, stories true
Who possesses the testicular fortitude
To blow away myths that's a hindrance to all of you
You blame your own shortcomings on sex and race
The mafia, homosexuals and all the Jews
It's hogwash point of views, stereotypical
Anti-Semitic like the foul words Gibson spewed
And it's pathetic, I don't get the credit I deserve
That's why I hate doing interviews
But I don't sweat it, study long, study raw
My man Dion said Nas over-think the songs he writing

Phonebook paper in my pocket, homie

Quit callin’ my phone if you ain’t talkin’ business
I’m out here on my grind, chasin’ 7 digits I already spend it, denim True Religion
Give 7 minutes, I can pull me 7 bitches
Plus I got a 7 in my Gucci tennis
Drop this shit off, I need a pooper-scooper with me
If you was with me, all you gotta do is do it with me
If you act right, I’ll take you to the movies with me 
The work here so I got that phone call…
I meant to say that bird call
I count money every night until I doze off
Ridin’ in the Jeep with the doors off
Got them 26s, so I took the 4s off
If I put the jewelry on, we done had a froze off
I do it for the Southside, spell it with an “F”
And the “F” stands for “Yeah, you fuckin’ with the best” Walk up in the club, lookin’ like a rapper
$30,000 all twenties, feeling like a trapper
We just wanna pour up that Ciroc, hoe
Why the fuck you think I brought this extra guap for?
A 100 miseed calls and they still text
20 bottles later I will still flex
My phone don’t get no service in the VIP
Her phone don’t get no service when she be with me, no!
We was bending corners in my Flying Spur
She never seen a car where the floor’s fur
My phone’s still ringin’, I can’t answer, though
I spent a lot of money, I ain’t count it, though
My cellphone ringing every 7 minutes
I’m out here on my grind, chasin’ 7 digits! 
A nigga so goddamn stressed out
I feel like fuck everything right now
See I've been broke too long, can't find a job to save my life
But I'll be damned if I give 'em my handout
See my pride is one thing I will not put aside
I'm too proud to beg, I'm sorry Left Eye
If I don't make it in life, motherfucker I tried
What? Uh You ever feel like nobody never understands you but you?
Not your momma, your poppa, only person is you
Not your brother, your sister, the only person is you
You ever feel like nobody never understands you but you?
Nobody, nobody but you
So it feels like, like it's only you So I'm feeling like I want to, I want to
I want to, I want to go so far from here
Very, very far from here
I need to, I need to
I need to, I need to go so far from here

Whatever you're doing turns out to be what-are-you-doing?
Sick of pursuing, that your time will soon come
Nobody knows the position that you in
But it's a million people out there that's going through the same thing
That feeling, hard to explain
When you just, just want to get away
Something like You ever feel like nobody never understands you but you?

Very, very far from here Away from it all
Take me out of Hell where only Heaven can visit
The smartest astronomers, they won't even see my vision
I'm stuck on the studio couch now, thinking bout my daughter
Times is getting harder, another beat is slaughtered
Just press record or, seems like I need a mill' to keep my shit in order
Instead of problem solving
From my hat to my shoes, spirit laced with pride
Set some shit aside to help me wipe my teary eyes
Reaching for the skies, pissing on a cloud
Shitting on a bird's head, higher than a dread
As I fly through the galaxy, pain and the agony
Nothingness surrounding me, living my life
Though it's better to write
Configuring my style to the streets, bring dark to the light
So how you feel? My nigga, I keep it real
A Schoolboy soon to be star, Mr. Lamar So I'm feeling like I want to, I want to
I want to, I want to go so far from here
Very, very far from here
I need to, I need to
I need to, I need to go so far from here
Very, very far from hereNone
Lil Bonez on the beat This thing go, for sho'ly
Only bustas I like, is Buster Posey
And the Bay is so trashy, murkish and murky
Crooked cops, crooked dice, they'll do you dirty
When I enter the neighborhood, when I pull up
People gather 'round me like an ice cream truck
They say, Uncle 40 waterwhat's the secret to life?
I'm trying to get on, I need some advice
I give 'em some game and then I dip
Off to the next episode, money to get
Can't be slippin' and snoozin' and cattin' off
If you lag, you lose man, your loss
My Ruger won't stutter to put you under the cover
Or should I say sheet, with a tag on yo' feet
Fetti' by the face ain't complexion as duct tape 
Then it's dark like shadows off the tree, bad apple
Cognac and Snapple sippin, spliffer twistin Swisher Sweets
Smokin and blowin and puffin on some Larry OG
Comin' around the corner, disrespectful-ass beat
Old peep can't sleep, call Johnny Law on me
I don't make it rain, I'm not a cloud
And I don't pay for coochy, coochy pay for me pal
You can find me double-fisted in the crowd, in the party talkin' loud
No harm, no foul And I be bangin' this shit when I'm bendin' that block 
Bendin' that block
And I be bangin' this shit when I bendin' that block

If you feel froggish, leap
He jumped, so I beat him like an egg
Cracked his shell, got on his head
Throw in the towel or we can take it farther
I got more drums than Travis Barker
Or should I say the Blue Men
Two sticks in my hand
I go ape on a fake if that's what he want
I'm not a chump, I'm from Vallejo California, I ain't no punk
B-boy apparel, candy Camaro
Sharp like a arrow, hood like valero
Badges be on me, they like my strategy
They love my attitude and personality
Crown me like a cavity, recognize royalty

Hit the corner like Uhh, rest in peace to Black Just
Riding through Jamaica Queens in his black truck
Timbs was forty below, waves to the side of his dome
Definition of good nigga, yo
Gangsters don't die, niggas only become immortal
Angels don't only fly, they walk right before you
In front of you
It’s foul what this money could do
Cash corrupts the loyal
I hung with E-Money too, the fucking truth
Fucking with Stretch from Live Squad
I could’ve died the same night that Stretch died
I just got out of his ride
He dropped me off and drove to Springfield
November 30th, another Queens king killed
It fucked me up, y’all
I was just trying to make it with Steve Stoute
The legal way, drug-free route
Back in the days, they was sleeping on us
Brooklyn keep on taking it, Manhattan keep on making it
Trying to leave Queens out
But we was pulling them Beems out, them M3's out
Pumping bringing them D's out
Rastas selling chocolate weed inside of a weed house
Colosseum downstairs, gold teeth mouth
Astoria warriors, eight street, twin buildings
Vernon, can’t even count the Livingston children
Justice in Ravenswood, nice neighborhood
Caught sleeping out there, be a wrap though
Bridge niggas be up in Petey’s ten racks, yo
A simple bet on a serious cash flow
Get money, Manolo, welcome home Castro
Queensbridge unified all I ask for
Let's do it for DU, say what up to Snacks, yo
I just salute real niggas when I pass through, uhh... Niggas is very hungry for that bank robbery
Bury money, trying to get to a Benz from a Hyundai
The Queens Courthouse right next to the cemetery
Niggas' rap sheets look like obituaries
You be starving in Kew Gardens
Bolognas and milk from a small carton
You could still feel chills from the team on 118
My nigga Bim fly by like it's a dream
His face on his Shirt Kings
Laced in a pinky ring, in his black Benz murking
Back when Black Rock and Ron was on the map
Cheeba in yellow sacks, dope sold in laundromats
Thugs bark, getting amped from weed
Over the heart of champions, see
Ever since back then, a nigga been about the dough
 Any other real niggas in the world besides us? I ask
Probably is, but odds are we’ll never cross paths
Put your glass high if you made it out the stash spot
And here to tell a story and celebrate the glory
Drinks in the air for my niggas not here
This how we do, I see you DU
Queens to the heavens, salute the hood legends
Crack the Patrón, Hennessy and Glenlivets
Champagne bottles drowning out the sorrows
Hope the memories'll get us through tomorrow
I’m a real OG 'cause back in '93
Niggas couldn't fuck with me, sipping 'gnac since I was little
Laid back in a rental
Mouth shining, Eddie’s gold caps all up in the dental
Nigga getting money now
But you know I'm still mental but not simple
Put your glass high if you made it out the stash spot
And here to tell your story and celebrate the glory
Drinks in the air for my niggas not here
This for the fallen soldiers, hold it down, I told you
Pop another bottle and keep the smoke rolling Watch the calm realest channel his mom's spirit
Goosebumps cover me, mother's here, I could feel her
Blood of Christ covers me, our savior and healer
Drug prices up or down, I know a few dealers
And some accident murderers, they act like they killed on purpose
Liars brag they put work in
You ain't mean to murk him, your gun's a virgin
Better stay on point, if not it's curtains
Bebo Posse reincarnated through me probably
If music money didn't stop me
I never claimed to be the toughest
Though I'm to blame for a few faces reconstructed
It's the game that we was stuck with
Now I'm the only black in the club with rich Yuppie kids
Sad thing, this is the top, but where the hustlers went
No familiar faces around, ain't gotta grab the musket
It's all safe and sound, champagne by the bucket
Where them niggas I shouted out on my first shit
Bo cooking blow, fuck is Slate at? Where Turkey went?
Old videos show niggas that was murdered since
Another reason to get further bent
Put your glass high if you made it out the stash spot
And here to tell your story and celebrate the glory
Drinks in the air for my niggas not here
This for the fallen soldiers, hold it down, I told you
Pop another bottle and keep the smoke rolling
We was club hoppin last night the homie got in a fight
He was drunk i hate wakin up to fuck
All kinda a text messages and voicemails on my jack
The nigga real into sayin they goin push my shit back
When they see me it’s on onsite no talk
This dog got a bite that will back up his bark
It’s started all over a broad no chedda
She was a site for sore eyes cool little put together
I kept tellin the homies that she was bad news
Knew a few dudes that been in her fallopian tubes
But he didn’t listen thought i was trippin
Know he bout to be dead or either in the prison
Most of the times it’s over some kitten man i ain't kiddin
If you slippin and trippin then good riddance
They think got ammunition but we got more
Assault weapons tear the head off a dinosaur
Bitch I hate wakin up to funk, funk, funk, funk, funk 
But i can’t let them think that i’m a punk
I hate wakin up to funk, funk, funk, funk, funk 
I’m still story tellin 
The art of story tellin

Bitch Rally up or should i say molly up
Had a little bit of lemon, a little bit of sprite in my styrofoam cup
To fuck em, get on em, fallet em, debone em
Scout them bitches for even thinkin about going to war with a boss
One a them punks forgot to turn they location off
So we found out where they sleepin rest they noggin
Parked right down the street in the bucket
Waited till they tweeted, post a picture man
Erry other minute they on instagram
Showcasing they showin they faces, braggin
Perpetrating  outta bounds laggin
Gotta be careful what you say they’ll research where you stay
Ain't no resets in the bay them nigga ain't for play
The element of surprise will bust a dusk or dime
Slaughter a motherfucker in his front lines Ugh ah
Meanwhile back at the crimescene
The hellacopters and homicide and forensics team
Takin reports and talkin to the neighbours
Porch to porch but the neighbours don’t wanna be on paper
So they keep they mouths zip, what they say
We was in the house watchin netfilx we didn’t see shit
Was it random or a hit that’s what the detectives say to victim family cryin throwin a fit
The new game if i tell his mama who did that ain't snitching
Yea it is my nigga get out in the street and handle business
Can’t be no powder puff just because he light skinned don’t think he ain't tuff
He’s gonna bust, imagine it, 9 times out off 10 his aim is accurate
They think they got ammunition but we got more

But I'm used to it 'cause all y'all charity cases
All y’all stare in my face in hopes you could be the replacement
Niggas is snitchin' on us without no interrogation
I stay silent 'cause we at war and I’m very patient
Six God is watchin', I just hope you’re prepared to face him

I’m flattered, man, in fact I’m amazed
The perfect start to the summer, man, this shit is a doozy
This shit a twist in the movie, but don't jump to conclusions
You boys are gettin' into your feelings on me
You should embrace it, this could be one of our realest moments
Okay, the flow start to feel familiar, don’t it?
Must I remind you that Jimmy got 20 million on it?
Need DJ Clue to drop a bomb on it
None of them want this shit more than I want it
I seen it all comin', knew they would push a button
East egg huntin', they gotta look for somethin'
Done doin' favors for people
'Cause it ain’t like I need the money I make off a feature
I see you niggas havin' trouble goin' gold
Turnin' into some so and so’s that no one knows
But so it go
Come live all your dreams out at OVO
We gon' make sure you get your bread and you know the ropes

Oh no we eatin', niggas ain’t about to starve us
Nah, niggas ain't about to starve us
I'm charged up I bought my niggas rollies off of Thank Me Later

I’m tryin' to take the high road
I still got love for my idols
I got me a deal with Apple and I still feel entitled
Rumor has it, there’s somethin' that only I know
Rumor has it, I steer the ship with my eyes closed
Rumor has it, I either fucked her or never could

It’s sound, sound, sound ‘til the day I die
We goin' live to keep this shit alive
Cops are killin' people with they arms up
And your main focus is tryna harm us?
And you think you ‘bout to starve us?
Niggas ain’t about to starve us
Nah, I’m charged up! 
Have you seen me?

Every time we meet:
Oh, I’m so sorry.
(Fuck niggas gon' be fuck niggas
That’s why we never give a fuck when a fuck nigga switched up) You know, I kept it real
It ain’t too many real people out here

Industry people… regular people…
And then when you keep it real with people, they cross the line, take your kindness for weakness and that’s weak.So G, it's me, LBC

No homo but please blow me to Japan
Okay I'm getting hotter I'mma need another fan
I keep going so here I go again
Always trying to be better than I am
Label me the best and in the throne I will stand
Why? Because I'm just a standup guy
Your hands smoking me cause I got your hands high
I pop a bean and bang Ja Rule when I Cry
You only know me but God knows I try
No x-ray show my insides
And I gotta stay in touch with my pimp side
So, tell your girl I said what's up.. I said hi..
She like that's what's up.. like the sky..
Byrd Gang taking off bitch watch em fly

Lock me up but you could never cave the blame
Gasoline, can you invision if our gaze was flames

You playing like your trying to get traded mane
And you ain't gotta call me the greatest mane
But I am more of a dog than the greatest dane
You boys acting like ladies mane
Crying like you bout to have babies mane
And you can find me grinding on the days we playin'
And that's because I know the sun'll raise again
And when it do I'mma praise the mane
They say you crazy Wayne, but I just bake em mane
And that's Ms. Baker saying, that I'm the... Hehe yeah
So, now I got..

Hahahaha... Lil tunechi bitch!
Young Moolah baby...
This here is on some truthful shit
Its seems like everything I do your use to it
And I hate hearing stories bout who you've been with!
Thats when I gotta hide what I'm feeling inside
So you still think I'm confident and damned
Is this gonna last?
You're up on a pedestal
Are we moving too fast?
Feels Like I'm in crazy competition with the past
That's why I gotta ask, is anything I'm doing brand new 
Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new
Is anything I'm doing brand new?
Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new

This here is something personal
Highly doubt this feeling is reversible
Knowledge is pain and that is why it hurts to know
That you attempt to hide, and put mistakes aside
So I dont ever question you and damn
I can't even find, the perfect brush
So I can paint whats going through my mind
Racing against myself, but I'm a couple steps behind
That's why I gotta ask, is anything I'm doing brand new? 
Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new
Is anything I'm doing brand new?
Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new girl

This here on some remix shit
Seems like ever thing I do they leakin it
And I hate hearing stories of who im sleeping with
I swear I got to hide what I got in my ride
So she still think im confident and damn
How long will this last
My life is on the pedestal, am I moving to fast?
Feel like im in crazy competition with my past
That's why I gotta ask
Is anything im doing brand new 
Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new
Is anything I'm doing brand new?
Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new

Remix baby if he can do good then I can do better
Dont blame me if any man would if he knew betterand dont won't to here about him anymore
But I know you heared this song before.. 
Is anything I'm doing brand new
Is everything I'm doing too late Did he take off your clothes off just like this
Did he give you loving just like this
Did you spend the night in his bed
On the very first date
Tell me baby am I too late? 
Is anything im doing brand new?
Brand new brand new
Show me if this is brand new, new
Ooh ohh yeah yeah yeah

YEAHHH! Hah, listen look You ain't tryin to hot box with me, I swing hard liquor
Goin down by the second round, all hail the underground
How dat sound? Xzibit backin down from a conflict
Fuck the nonsense, terrorist, hidden bomb shit
Glass and metal in every direction
Innocent bystanders taught a very hard lesson
I'm the reason there's no time to reach for that weapon
And reason why niggas with problems keep on steppin
Xzibit ready to scrap, like Mike Tyson with his license back
Nine to five, minimum wage, what type of life is that
For me? It's blasphemy, you fuckin around
With the Sundance Kid and Butch Cassidy
You had the audacity to wanna tangle with the X
Strangle your neck, slap you like the opposite sex
Drunk drivin tryin to stack my loot
While other rappers gettin Treated Like a Prostitute
So check the SoundScan All I wanna be was a G, ha

But you know me, Dogg I'm movin
Ain't nuttin to it, but to get to groovin

To take that chance and rob yo' man and beat up the pussy
A victim of the circumstance

Tricking fools, got a whole Robin Givens crew that I kick it to

Let's describe a certain female
Let's describe a certain female Say Jay-Z, why you gotta go and disrespect the women for, huh?  Sisters get respect, bitches get what they deserve
Sisters work hard, bitches work your nerves
Sisters hold you down, bitches hold you up
Sisters help you progress, bitches will slow you up
Sisters cook up a meal, play their role with the kids
Bitches in street with their nose in your biz
Sisters tell the truth, bitches tell lies
Sisters drive cars, bitches wanna ride
Sisters give-up the ass, bitches give-up the ass
Sisters do it slow, bitches do it fast
Sisters do their dirt outside of where they live
Bitches have niggas all up in your crib
Sisters tell you quick you better check your homie
Bitches don't give a fuck, they wanna check for your homie
Sisters love Jay 'cause they know how Hov' is
I love my sisters, I don't love no bitch
Can't ever do right, can't lose this fight, I'm already low
I think the demons are winning
I can't ever do right, I can't lose this fight, I'm already low
I think I need new beginnings
I think the demons are winning
They beat me up
Don't wish me away, wish me luck, yeah yeah
I'll be good either way
Who am I to say what good ain't?
I'm finding my way, my way 
You can feel it inside you
Don't let it in, it likes you
Don't let it in, feel it inside you
Don't let it in, it likes you
Blaze a 50, sit back in the drop top Azure Bentley
Of course with me, this chick'll make Bobby divorce Whitney
Brazilian candy, from Miami
Masseuse, wedding ring on, loving Celine Dion
Hate rap, told me where she get cake at
She's a part-time dancer, part time romancer
Tries to be a mother when she gets a chance to
Left her husband alone to raise they son, he's in Pampers
Modeled for a year, got her bachelors degree
33, recovering from plastic surgery
Went from 34B to 36 double D
Met her in San Diego at tha Super Bowl party
Had the Henny, sipped it up with Terrell Davis
MVP, we flicked it up from Sports Illustrated
I was silked out, flossing with Stoute, he had the gators
When she walked in, she lit up the room like Las Vegas
Terrell said her man's a fullback for the Raiders
A drunk who'd fuck cheerleaders and wind up in the papers
It's easy to get the pussy, just don't fall in love
Next thing you know I'm hugged up with this bitch in the tub
Palm Springs, Al Capone's Suite washing her feet
Is this love? Somebody's wife fucking a thug
Hitting it raw, tasting it, wilding out of my character
Taping it, Tyra Banks face and Faith's lips
Giving head like she knew me for years
Pillow talk, she let out tears, told me bout her husbands affairs
Millions she would get if his neck got slit
She rolled the equality, then passed the la to me
Told me 'bout her man's life insurance policy
He stays on the golf course, wears Le Coq Sport
Evenings he drinks his wines on his private resort
You can take him there, here go the keys, you can slip in the rear
Chop a nigga up, yo, meet me somewhere
So we can make more money, then you could ever see rapping
Split the cash and move to Venezuela, adapting
P-11's, ACP shells for blasting
Caught him with his Spanish maid
He had a lighter with a can of spray, burning her legs
She tied to the bed, sex S&M, sadomasochistic
Sadistic, yoked her from behind, blew him out existence
His maid cried No, lucky she was blindfold
Naked with mad burn marks all on her thighs, yo
Twelve point five million, he kept his funds
In the Lloyd's of London, goes to his wife and his children
Yo, I thought What if shorty gets scared, electric chair's all I envision
All she'll probably get is psychiatric supervision
I switched the plan, the maid flied to Switzerland
Fake ID, forged his wife name, catch the next flight
The same night, headed to Spain, nice game
Now we're back to where we meet again... Blaze a 50, sit back in a drop-top Azure Bentley
Of course with me, this chick'll make Bobby divorce Whitney
Top down, night air blow her hair
Sky black, stars glow, the face on the moon stare
Fast lane on the nine-five, honey laughs about the cash
Took a blast out of her coke bag
Snorted it, started screaming, yo we almost crashed
Earlier I took the coke out, replaced it with crushed up glass
Her head nodded down to her chest, slowly she fell asleep
Overwhelmed by greed, put to death
Rolling stocky, kinda brocky on the streets where niggas watch me
If you plotting I'mma prol'ly get to pop at your noggin
I'm a Hollygrove problem, like Follow me yeah
Come and be my death volunteer,
That's why I'm here, I come to get that scratch
I done been to jail twice and tell them crackers I ain't never going back, huh?
Rode through the city with the metal on my back, huh?
Gave me a shot and I sent several of 'em back, huh?
Gave me some money, they won't ever get it back now
One million, two million, three million: I'm stacked now
No more crack now, it's in the back for now
Just in case she crack down
I never back down, shit bitch, I might react now
But, 4 million, 5 million, 6 million: I'm that now
Where you at clown? I'm high in the sky
You at ground, so set down you bitch you Money on my mind, pistol on my side
I make a nigga hide that pride
I ain't got time for you bitches, I'm trying get these riches
Real niggas know that vision
I ain't time for you haters, I'm trying get this paper
Real ladies know that labor
I ain't got time for you snitches, I'm trying get them riches
Real niggas know that vision You motherfuckers know what I'm out here doing
And you ain't gotta buy it, if you not into it
Dope block influenced, blue pale light, scream
I'm on that same ass block letting the bell ring
Looking for the boy, the one in the back
I could get your stomach out of your back
I could make you shit better, this better, than what them selling
They need drugs no penicillin and I'm the medicine man
Yes I am him, yup-yup
Hip-hip, hoo-ray, 20 hard came today
And two large was the pay, and the Coast Guard said it was okay
Bring them barge to the bay
And my bitch looks like a DeBarge so I call her bait
She put packs in her bra, and the keys in the case
If she ever try to skate with the cake, and relocate
I got her social and her birth date, bitch please I talk like a hustler, walk like a hustler
Stripper attitude, only money make me move
Dapper dan status, I'm the stunner part two
I got an image to uphold, and my image do, too
I'm off the scrimmage line like Emmitt 2-2
Why would the quarterback give it to you?
I gotta hundred sacks, and a hundred women; French twist
And we don't even talk, we just French kiss, I could never get pinched
I'm rocking like a big pimp
Momma only dated hustlers, so I could only commend them
And never roll with a dummy on your hip
Have the judge giving you a run-on sentence
Never that, I keep the gun on for that business
And when I'm not, I'm at business
See that's that, mad business, peep the simplistics
It's Cash Money, nigga, just live it 
Throwin’ up the upside down M 
E-40, the W, like the hotel
West Coast! Y’all picked the right person to bring this shit to life
I’mma speak some real this
This how that shit go down
I’m the soul narrator It’s zany on these dumping grounds
Don’t be slippin’ with your pants down
They got some big shit hundred rounds
That’ll knock you out your shoes and spin your neck around
Crooked cops, crooked dice, crooked streets
Dark guns, dark alleys, dark reefs
Don’t get fooled by the palm trees and the beach
They wake your ass up, put the pistol to your teeth
Where the safe at? Where the shoe box? Where your duffel, patna?
Lost souls, they don’t believe in karma
The fast lane, fast cars, fast cash
Bad bitches, big titties, big ass 
Celebrities and socialites
Pimps, gangstas, and hustlas under the streetlights
They’ll run up on ya, make sure you with some real ones
When you come in California Even when it’s flying high
Watching the weather
Up above, the city skies
And gettin’ it together
California, California Cali, the land of opportunity
San Quintin and Silicon Valley
Where they learn to play the corner
Where they play with drumsticks that’ll go through body armour
In the Pacific to be specific 
Where they’ll follow you on the freeway
Catch you gettin’ off an exit when you least expect it
Unexpected, in the middle of the daylight where the traffic hectic
Bold, cold, these judges ain’t plannin’ on gettin’ old, old
Got hit now he layin’ up in the road, road
His mama outside up in her robe, robe 
 West Coast!
You sick out this bitch, as I squash like this
The fog and the mist 
I yell that shit out, that’s all that I know, that’s how that shit go Even when it’s flying high
Watching the weather
Up above and try hard to
Get it together
California, California Up above the cities skies in California
And soon we'll be flying high in California
In California I know you can feel the magic, baby
Turn the motherfuckin' lights down
Esco, whattup? 
I mean, it's what you expected, ain't it? 
Let's go... uhh, uh, uhh, uh, uhh, uh
Turn the music up in the headphones
Uh, yeah, that's perfect 
Uhh, uh, you gotta take ya time, make a nigga wait on this muh'fucka 
Make niggas mad and shit like
Niggas usually just start rappin' after four bars, nigga, go in!
Just start dancin' in this muh'fucka
Yeah,  we just come outta nowhere I feel like a Black Republican, money I got comin' in
Can't turn my back on the hood, I got love for them
Can't clean my act up for good, too much thug in him 
Probably end up back in the hood, like, Fuck it then Huddlin' over the oven, we was like brothers then 
Though you was nothin' other than a son of my mother's friend
We had covenant, who would've thought the love would end?
Like Ice Cold's album , all good things
Never thought we sing the same song that all hoods sang
Thought it was all wood-grain, all good brain
We wouldn't bicker like the other fools, talk good game
Never imagine all the disaster that one good reign, could bring
Should blame, the game, and I could
It's kill or be killed, how could I refrain?
And forever be in debt, and that's never a good thing
So the pressure for success can put a good strain
On a friend you call best, and yes it could bring
Out the worst in every person, even the good and sane
Although we rehearsed it, it just ain't the same
When you put in the game at age sixteen
Then you mix things: like cars, jewelry, and Miss Thing
Jealousy, ego, and pride, and this brings
It all to a head like a coin, cha-ching
The root of evil strikes again, this could sting
Now the team got beef between the Post and the Point
This puts the ring in jeopardy – indefinitely I feel like a black republican, money I got comin' in
Can't turn my back on the hood, I got love for them 
Can't clean my act up for good, too much thug in him 
Probably end up back in the hood, I'm like, Fuck it then
I feel like a black militant takin' over the government
Can't turn my back on the hood, too much love for them 
Can't clean my act up for good, too much thug in him
Probably end up back in the hood, I'm like, Fuck it then I'm back in the hood, they like, Hey Nas 
Blowin' on purp, reflectin' on they lives 
Couple of fat cats, couple of A.I.'s
Dreamin' of fly shit instead of them gray skies
Gray 5s, hatah's wishin' our reign dies
Pitch, sling pies, and niggas they sing, Why? 
Guess they ain't strong enough to handle their jail time
Weak minds keep tryin', follow the street signs
I'm standing on the roof of my building
I'm feelin' the whirlwind of beef, I inhale it
Just like an acrobat ready to hurl myself, through the hoops of fire
Sippin' 80 proof, bulletproof under my attire
Could it be the forces of darkness
Against hood angels of good, that form street politics?
Makes a sweet honest kid, turn illegal for commerce 
To get his feet out of them Converse – that's my word I feel like a black republican, money keep comin' in
Can't turn my back on the hood, I got love for them 
Can't clean my act up for good, too much thug in him 
Probably end up back in the hood, ah, Fuck it then
I feel like a black militant takin' over the government
Can't turn my back on the hood, too much love for them
Can't clean my act up for good, too much thug in him
Probably end up back in the hood, I'm like, Fuck it then
Uh, I don't wanna try bruh Uh, acidic, a bunch of bad habits with bad magic
Can't disappear and re-appear in the same sentence, I'm bad at it
The Mad Hatter, the Perc packer
The mom thrasher
The Perc mixed with the syrup turn me into a contractor
A straight tweak, so high I can't speak
Been three weeks, I still haven't met my peak
Like I could be someone other than myself
Like I could find a little Heaven up in my Hell
Yeah I know it never ever end well
Yeah I know I always fall victim to a rich spell
Uh, like abracadabra
The flow so raw, forgot to grab Magnums
Been raw-doggin' bitches ever since I went platinum
I feel like Hell full of bad bitches
Wonder if it's room in Heaven for savages
My life's a canvas, I'm paintin' in blood like a cannibal
Rip off his head and I salvage it, huh
A little too graphic
At least you niggas know that I still got the passion
Of someone who don't got shit, but the clothes on they back
And its been that way since way back since
Like I'm a killer or somethin'
These niggas lip-singin' like Milli Vanilli or somethin'
I'm like Lil' Wayne I got a milli-milli-milli or somethin'
I guess, I'm rich, in broke pockets
Bountiful, my soul's empty, so deep, ten feet Times ten feet
Fuck love, it's gon' take more to convince me, that you with me
And not against me
Where I'm from we loaded up
Pop out and turn niggas into mince meat 
Nope, yup
Nope, yup
Nope, yup
Nope, yup Did it happen in one day?
Came a long way? 
Never know what kind of angle 
Crossover break your ankles 
Sloppy with the rock? 
Stephen Curry with the shot? 
Suckers? 
Splash Brothers? 
Ain't no stopping 
Klay Thompson 
Under pressure is he choking 
Do it big like Bogut 
Never let them tell us that we can't 
Go hard like Barnes in the paint 
Never ever slowing down the pace 
Shoot a 3 pointer in his face! 
Errybody say Warriors 
Errybody say Warriors

Got something to say? 
Foo this is the Bay! 
Coward? 
Hustle like Iguodala? 
Do we ever play weak? 
Finesses it like David Lee 
Ain't no body better than my team 
Money like Draymond Green 
Ain't nobody finna crush our dream 
Won't stop until we get a ring 
Errybody say Warriors 
Errybody say Warriors 
Errybody say Warriors  These haters is hating they already know
But we never going to choke

I'mma gonna stay get money 
I don't care if you don't like me 
I'mma stay get money 
I'm pregnant, don't know who the dad is
I'm happy, but this shit's the saddest
I'm maintaining, still keeping my status
Fuck what you haters say, my ass is still the fattest
Roll with the baddest, my girls in Gucci glasses
How could you pass this? Your loss
But I ain't tripping - I'm still the boss
I won't be another black girl lost
Lost, lost, lost, lost, Lost, lost
I won’t be another black girl lost Brown and beautiful, black and stunning, light and delicious
Chocolate colored strawberry kisses and cherry lipstick
Very mystic, bald stitches her wig
Kinky curly and dread, goddess gon' grant my wishes
Tantalizing touches, succulent skin, we should wed
Start off broke then stay together 'til we make it big
My queen is english, Sojourner Truth, I could learn from you
Never Ike Turner you, but look what you turn and do like
Get out of order, you're not a supporter of my dream
Rich girl fantasy schemes, a good man she needs
But she young and she speeding, honey now, what's the reason?
You just met this nigga, think you owe him a fucking threesome
So you lustin' to have a baby by a Denver Nugget
You don't love him, you want security, baby, your bugging
Financial liberty you're after, it's how you live
But the blood test shows it's not even his kid Chanel bags, everything
She shopping every time she gets a wedding ring
This her 3rd marriage, 4 carats
Brand new Jag, deserves to have it
Temptation, she can't let go her dirty habits
Mid 30's, spendin' dough at Magic
She's dancin', romancin', she's up at Mansion
She fucks all my mans, and they pop the magnums
So now what you gonna do, the morning-after pill is way overdue
'Posed to get married, now you embarassed
Who does this kid belong to?
Promiscuous, cuz' she got touched by step-dad, sex at
Such a young age, if you was a virgin, I'd get mad
Sick society, blaming yourself so wrong
I highly respect you, bet that, strong, intelligent
This song ain't to poke fun of you, to get laughs
I just love you, really love you
Here for you, wanna trust you
Wanna cuff you, be my lady
But first, I gotta see the baby Ladies, I believe in you
We gotta stop this craziness out here, though
We gotta get right
Because when we both get right, we both take flight
Us real men need you, for real
Yeah, yeah. So, y'all all curious. That's fine. That's fine, man. I'm – look, I'm a tell ya how ya boy, Moochie, landed his ass in this goddamn slammer. It was Kendrick. Yeah, Kendrick Lamar. Yeah, right. This motherfucker. That's right. Shit was wild, goddamnit. This motherfucker. We had a ball. Ay, nigga, you ain't gotta believe me, nigga. Goddamnit. He's just talkin' about it. Man, you ain't been in here that long. Your perm still new. So, anyways. You know what I'm sayin'? We had some strippers. They let us do everything we wanted to do, touch anything we wanted to touch. I was puttin' my finger in places, but my nail 'bout to fall off. Kill these motherfuckers. You hear me? I hear you. Get that money and come out. Man, you should a heard what this li'l' nigga was talkin', man. Talkin' so much shit on the block. Man, I been tryin' to tell ya. He talkin' 'bout he gon' get more money than me, he gon' get more money than you. I said, Fuck this motherfucker, man. This li'l' motherfucker 'bout to get hit right now. Fuck him. Fuck this motherfucker right now. Man, Malcolm, shut the fuck up. We gon' go in here, get the money, get out. Simple as that. But you ain't hear what he said. Nigga, I'm a smoke yo' ass. Now you fi'n' a get smoked, talkin' shit. What, bitch? What? What? Let's go. Let's go. Come on. You're talkin' that shit. Where is this motherfucker? Nigga, fuck outta here. What the fuck, man? People can get murdered. Yeah. Here we go. Yeah. Yeah. What? What? What? What? Pull him up. Uh. We 'bout to murder this shit.  Murder this. Murder that. Yeah. Murder that and this. Ha, we killin' this bitch. We killin' this bitch. We killin' it. Get the fuck up. Get your standin' on, niggas. It's a stand-on, motherfucker. Y'all ain't seen no shit like this. Hey, boy. By the time I got there, I was already two bottles and three pussies-deep. . But somethin' was off. I knew somethin' was wrong, man. You know, you get that feelin' sometimes. Like, when a real, cute woman is showin' you genuine love. Ay, that ain't right. But that's when I saw Kendrick out there gettin' down wit' my lady. Man, I spent the night at her house and walked her daughter to school. You know, that means you obligated to me. But I wasn't trippin' too much, you know? Like I said, I was already three pussies-deep. You know, I got respect for your boy, Kendrick, a little bit. Yeah, everythin' was cool, man. Well, shit, man, ain't nobody told me. I got these cops runnin' up on me 'cause I hit the back of the goddamn cop car. It wasn't my fault. I'm all ready to kick it with K-Dot and them tenders, man, and these cops sweatin' me about hittin' the ass of the car, goddamnit. I told them I hit the ass. I don't give a fuck if it's a fly. 
Uhh, yeah, uhh
Blessings of life to the children, they say life is like five days
Words of a old man with silver hair, in his wheelchair
His eyes were bloody while describin' what lies before me
Said evil bitches and jealous men would try to destroy me
It occurred to me, this old nigga's words couldn't be realer
I'm on top now, slightest drama, I'll have ta kill ya
'Cause animals sense weakness, sharks smell blood in water
Ishmael, Moses and Job knew the divine order
Shit is plastic material, havin' no life
I crash whips and leave it no matter the price
As long as I survive, cop a new five
Circle the block where the beef's at
And park in front of my enemy's eyes
They see that it's war we life stealers, hollow-tip lead busters
There's no heaven or hell - dead is dead fuckers
And your soul is with God, your mind keeps lurkin' the earth
Watchin' your own murder reoccur For ever struggle, every strip, and every ghetto
For every nigga totin' inner pain and heavy metal
For every child that's born, and every nigga gone
And for every breath I breathe and live to see another morning
For ever struggle, every strip, and every ghetto
For every nigga totin' inner pain and heavy metal
For every child that's born, and every nigga gone
And for every breath I breathe and live to see another morning It's Blitz nigga the streets glory many die for me
Got knocked, refused 3 to 9's, went to trial for me
Basically I'm just reality, loaded with foul stories of lust
Greed and contempt, no street is exempt
Extended clip shots, hoods barricaded for 6 blocks
I sip shots, watchin em hustlers pitch rocks
Oil paintin' pictures of my pain, illustrate the city in vain
Fallin deep into the pits of the game
This is for the sickest state of mind, in these fatal times
Vest crimes, nickel-plated nines and niggas for the dime
Hear the sounds of them babies cry, still I'm sayin why do we reside
In the ghetto with a million ways to die
Stayin' high to relieve the pain, breathin' in the game
Exhalin' guilt sin and shame, misery and strain
What the fuck will tomorrow bring; luck or anthrax
I stand back, hopin' I'll make it through tomorrow My skin is a art gallery, right - with paintings of crucifixes
Hopin' to save me from all the dangers in the music business
Was once a young gangsta hangin' with youth offenders
But since I tasted paper it started losin the friendships
Watchin' kids freeze in winters, they still poor
How could I tease them with Benzes and feel no remorse
Drivin' past them in the lively fashion, diamond colors clashin'
Red stones, blue stones, red bones and black ones
Fuck did I expect with bucket seats in a Lex
And spendin' time in Chuckie Cheese with Little Des
Got guns when I'm with my daughter
Hate to bring a violent aura in her presence
She knows what daddy taught her, it's lessons
Black princess it's a ugly world
I put my life up for yours, see I love that girl
Could you believe even my shadow's jealous
My skin is mad at my flesh, my flesh hates my own bones
My brain hates my heart, my heart makes the songs
Though my songs come from the Father
I'm lonely... hold me, it's gettin' darker For ever struggle, every strip, and every ghetto
For every nigga totin' inner pain and heavy metal
For every child that's born, and every nigga gone
And for every breath I breathe and live to see another morning
For ever struggle, every strip, and every ghetto
For every nigga totin' inner pain and heavy metal
For every child that's born, and every nigga gone
And for every breath I breathe and live to see another morning
Turn your radios up
The real niggas are back on the radio This is for my niggas, niggas, niggas
This is for my niggas, niggas, niggas 
This is for my niggas, niggas, niggas
This is for my niggas, niggas, niggas  Uh, no slackin', no beggin', no askin', no fastin'
No disrespect to Islam, no Imam or Pastor
No answers to questions the media's askin'
Why we fight each other in public in front of these arrogant fascists?
They love it; puttin old niggas verse the youngest
Most of our elders failed us, how could they judge us? Niggas
There's verbal books published by niggas, produced by niggas
Genuine niggas, so I salute my niggas
Not mad cause Eminem said nigga, cause he my nigga
Wigga, cracker, friend, we all black within, okay?
We all African, okay, some Africans don't like us, no way!
A killng happened in Johannesbur yesterday
Slain artist named Lucky Dube, hijacked
Some say N-double A-C-P, keep us sidetracked
But I don't buy that, I buy Aston Martins
Faster cars than NAS-a-CARs and, sparkin while ridin
Critics, eat a dick! Journalists see I'm rich
With this N-word jargon I'm just starting, bitch! This is for my niggas, niggas, niggas
This is for my niggas, niggas, niggas 
This is for my niggas, niggas, niggas
This is for my niggas, niggas, niggas  Wake up in the morning, shake my third leg in the toilet
Uzi on the nightstand, I'm the man you go to war with
Not the man you go to war against, patience, I'll get you
If that means I can't sleep a whole year, I'mma get you
I'm official, not a-tisket or a-tasket
I'll put you in the casket, with the biscuit or the ratchet
They smoke hibiscus, they plants or trees, advanc-ed weed
Don't forsake us, you all are fake bloods like move make-up
I flow tighter as Tootie's braces, who he hatin us?
I be on a state bus in shackles if my .8 bust
Cause y'all some tellers, opposite of bankers
I'm the shit for ages, my clique still real QB gangsters
Clique still movin' like Freemasons, so if I'm on the flow
From the law, there's lodges all across the nation
Nas is bred for the plan
To hold the Grand Dragon's head in my hand
Come and get me, here I am This is for my niggas, niggas, niggas
This is for my niggas, niggas, niggas 
This is for my niggas, niggas, niggas
This is for my niggas, niggas, niggas 
They said this day would never come
They said our sights were set too high
This country is too divided, too disillusioned
To ever come together around a common purpose. They said (Although it seems heaven-sent
We ain't ready, to have a black president)
(Although it seems heaven-sent
We ain't ready, to have a black president)
Yes we can change the world, the world, the world
{CHANGE THE WORLD...} they say
(Although it seems heaven-sent
We ain't ready, to have a black president)
(Although it seems heaven-sent
We ain't ready, to have a black president)
Yes we can, change the world
The world, the world, the WORLD... They forgot us on the block, got us in the box
Solitary confinement: how violent are these cops?
They need a early retirement
How many rallies will I watch? I ain't got it in me to march
I got a Semi to spark, the game's in a drought
Public housing, projects, cooking up in the Pyrex
My set, my clique, either getting money
Or running from homicide trail, that's if they ain't died yet
Trying to be rich, still I'm pledging allegiance
A predicate felon, a ghetto leader
Lending my poetical genius, to whoever may need it
I bleed this from Queensbridge, now living with my feet up
Never defeated, so a president's needed
You know these colored folks and Negros hate to see
One of their own succeeding
America: surprise us and let a black man guide us, uhh (Although it seems heaven-sent
We ain't ready, to have a black president)
(Although it seems heaven-sent
We ain't ready, to have a black president)
Yes we can, change the world
{CHANGE THE WORLD...} they say
(Although it seems heaven-sent
We ain't ready, to have a black president)
(Although it seems heaven-sent
We ain't ready, to have a black president)
Yes we can, change the world
The world, the world, the WORLD... What's the black pres' thinking on election night?
Is it: How can I protect my life?
Protect my wife? Protect my rights?
Every other president was nothing less than white
Except Thomas Jefferson had mixed Indian blood.. and Calvin Coolidge
KKK is like: What the fuck?!, loading their guns up
Loading up mine too, ready to ride
'Cause I'm riding with my crew - he dies, we die too
Yeah, but on the positive side
I think Obama provides hope and challenges minds
Of all races and colors to erase the hate
And try to love one another, so many political snakes
We in need of a break, I'm thinking I can trust this brother
...but will he keep it way real?
Every innocent nigga in jail gets out on appeal
When he wins, will he really care still?
I feel (Although it seems heaven-sent
We ain't ready, to have a black president)
(Although it seems heaven-sent
We ain't ready, to have a black president)
Yes we can, change the world
{CHANGE THE WORLD...} they say
(Although it seems heaven-sent
We ain't ready, to have a black president)
(Although it seems heaven-sent
We ain't ready, to have a black president)
Yes we can, change the world
The world, the world, the WORLD... Say a prayer for Do we have to?
You ain't right, Jeremiah Wrong pastor
In love with a slave master
Sincerely yours, USA's most brave rapper
Jesse carjacker, Uncle Tom kidnapper
Ask around: Bentley coupe off the Richter
Bitch called Life: I pimped her, what
Politics, politricks, Klan-shooter
Deacon for defense, progress-producer
Nothing on the stove, a survival-booster
Gotta do what we gotta do
We ain't got no governors coming through to help
Anything we need done, gotta do for self
New, improved JFK on the way
It ain't the 60s again, niggas ain't hippies again
We ain't falling for the same traps
Standing on the balconies where they shot the King at
McCain got apologies; ain't nobody hearing that
People need honesty (Although it seems heaven-sent
We ain't ready, to have a black president)
(Although it seems heaven-sent
We ain't ready, to have a black president)
Yes we can, change the world
{CHANGE THE WORLD...} they say
(Although it seems heaven-sent
We ain't ready, to have a black president)
(Although it seems heaven-sent
We ain't ready, to have a black president)
Yes we can, change the world
The world, the world, the WORLD... It is my distinct honor, and privilege to introduce
The next President of the United States - Barack Obama

Reklam için bana diss atan ergen
Klibimi koymuş bir de göt kafalı dörtgen
Adrenalin patlaması, ritim çok pis tutturuyom
Hayranların piç kurusu, sağda solda haykırıyor
Laftan falan anlamıyon, anan burada sallanıyor
Baban ananı sikerken takma yarrak kullanıyor
Götveren Arjantin'i sike sike doymadım
Şerefimiz var bizim gidip de vatanı satmadık
Sizin gibi götlere bu sözlerim az bile
Soka soka patladı, çekinek mi selfie'ye
Bizi tanı lan piç, yoksa seni yaşatmam
Kerhane değil bura, siker siker çıkartmam
Dokuz canlı olsan bile bitireceğim lan seni
Diss attığın adamlar götüne soktu anteni
Diyorlar ki lan bana Küfür etme bilader
Karışma lan piç kurusu, göte yarrak lak girer
Ananı, bacını, tüm sülaleni sike sike morarttım
Ananı hata bağlayıp amdan sakat bıraktım
Kasırga Part 3 ulan, Alper Çakır söylüyor
Sazını mazını siktim işte, köpek gibi havlıyor

Excuse me, miss, I don't appreciate your rudeness
But if you strip, I will appreciate your nudeness
I heard the best head come from girls that is toothless
Yeah my game ruthless, yeah my car roofless
Spit that Through The Wire over Chaka Khan, ruthless
She said she had a friend look like Janet Jackson
That bitch came over lookin' more like Freddie Jackson
Nah, nah, nah, baby, won't be no time for no action

Your friends say I'm a player, you'd be lucky to keep me
You know people gon' be talkin' 'bout us weekly
My car be in a robbery
P-O-R-T but what's more important to me is that
Don't be comin' 'round my girl tryna act like Mr. Friendly
And steal the spotlight like Mr. Bentley
I spotted her like Spud McKenzie
And for them fake boobies, I paid them Benjis
Get your own
I got Paris, he got Nicky, he tried to get him a clone
He said, Ye, you know you got extra hoes
And everything you do is extra cold
From the Polo fleece to the Jesus piece
I got family in high places like Jesus niece
Can I please say my peace?
If y'all fresh to death then I'm deceased
And this one here is a heat rock, spit like a beatbox
The way the beat rocks, new version of Pete Rock
But for that Benz I get CL love
So I switched my girls around like 3L dub
My favorite girl wanna leave me just because I got a girlfriend
My freak girl told me now she's a Christian
My white girl wanna move back to Michigan
I'm pullin' girls off the bench like a 6th man
I'm in the club pullin' the same old two step
While Omegas doin' the same old Q step
I had my money on my mind, I was thinkin' green
She a pledge, AKA, she was pink and green
I want a good girl, she want a gentleman
We sayin' the same thing like a synonym
I wasn't really spittin' game, I was scrimmagin'
My penmanship is so hard it needs censorship
I'm a Chicago win 'til Chicago wins

Mothafucka you would fuck up a free lunch
Dawg, keep it right thurr like Chingy
Your girl don't like me? How long has she been gay?
Spanish girls ask me, No habla ingles
And everybody wanna run to me for their sin-glay
It's funny how these wack niggas need my help
Wasn't around when I couldn't feed myself
Dawg if I was you I wouldn't feel myself
Dawg if I was you I'd kill myself
That Ethiopian chick drinkin' straight up liquor
I told her I'm Nigerian, that's straight up nigga
She claimed she ain't hear me on The Bounce with Jigga
She claimed she ain't see me on the basement with Tigga
Them both my niggas, I suppose
I might have been doin' a lil' frontin' for the hoes
When I flip flows, I rip shows
And your girlfriends, can I hit those?
I don't know if it's me, or do them Uggs
Got girl's feets lookin' like sheepskin rugs
Some rhyme with her name, some rhyme nameless
Don't try to treat me like I ain't famous
My apologies, are you into astrology?
Cause umm... I'm tryna make it to your anus
See that's a little John Juan game
All across your chest like Sean John's name
Niggas tryna figure out since Kan' came

My dawg Hip-Hop really love Claudette
So if I ever get to smash, this fuck's for you
I can barely drive the G5 down King Drive

I'ma let y'all just talk about how good I rap for a minute and I'ma come back So I dropped out of school cause I'm tryna eff the tutor
Her ex man drove a Mercury Cougar

When our heroes or heroines got hooked on heroin
Crack raised the murder rate in D.C. and Maryland
We invested in that, it's like we got Merrill lynched
And we been hangin' from the same tree ever since
Sometimes I feel the music is the only medicine
So we cook it, cut it, measure it, bag it
Sell it, the fiends cop it, nowadays they can't tell if

Put the CD on your tongue, yeah, that's pure, man Uh, that's that crack music, crack music

Who gave Saddam anthrax?
George Bush got the answers
Back in the hood it's a different type of chemical
Arm & Hammer baking soda raised they whole quota
Right when our soldiers, ran for the stove 'cause

Yo, I wonder if Langston Hughes and Alex Haley
Got blazed before they told stories

So he had him cremated
Took his ashes and then made it to a diamond ring
Now he watches his son shine everyday
I just thought about that
While I sit here ashing in this ash tray, yeah The making of a mad band, intricate stories of DeVante Swing
Ava Gardner, the crashin' of James Dean
Bobby Brown influenced by Rick James and it goes
Prince wanted Alexander O'Neal to be Morris Day or Jerome
But Alex was putting coke in his nose, nigga whylin'
Could be a myth, but I swear that the source was close
Phyllis Hyman killed herself, it was crazy
Mommy was bad they say
Donny Hathaway free-fall from a balcony, he swings As the blunt ash falls into the ash tray
I could see my whole life fly past me
Did I? Did I keep it gangsta or keep it classy?
And will the money and fame outlast me?
The blunts ash falls down in the ash tray
Well, I see my whole life fly past me
I'm asking, did I keep it gangsta or keep it classy?
Did I? Anything else you wanna know, just ask me Sam trusted Womack with his main lady
He tossing in the grave like, This is how you repay me?!
A change gon' come, wish you didn't trust me so much
Marvin said No mountain's high enough, fly stuff
David Ruffin was punchin' Tammi Terrell
Gave her concussions
While the Funk Brothers was laying down the percussion
When Flo from the Surpremes died, Diana Ross cried
Many people said that she was laughin' inside John F. Kennedy's enemies dealt with treachery
It interests me. Judy Campbell in Gucci sandals
She's what a temptress be
The death of Ennis Cosby, what a mystery!
Or the Chicagoan Harold Washington
Someone is sabotaging 'em
Watch out for the traps
Larry Troutman killed his brother Roger Troutman
Then he killed himself, that's the end of Zapp
And I wouldn't change a thing, mistakes of the greats
This is what came from their pain
From their hurt we gain, an unfair exchange I could smell old bogey cigars
Long record perfumes, smelling just as sweet
Me and my wife K, flying in a drop-top
Like Ruby and Ossie Davis, baby – know what I mean?
Yo, man, I get smoked out, and start thinking 'bout
Hattie McDaniel got a Oscar
For playing Mammy in Gone with the Wind
And she didn't get allowed
Wasn't even allowed to go to the premier
Believe that? Couldn't go to premier to her joint
Man, you know they were strong back then, man
Blunt from my ash tray, nothing gon' to live past me, yeah
Ugh
Stick with it hahaha

YEAH YEAH  They say he wanted the bounce back
I can make them easily admit that the bounce back
Without knowing exactly where my accounts at
Yeah, you best believe
That I often tend to surpass what the rest achieve
So, they don't like me
They throw parties, and yet they never invite me
I can't lie, sometime it bother me slightly
Either way the true fans yell
I appear calm, and it's obvious of who can't tell
And no, this ain't Blu Cantrell
This is like perfection, though we both got the light complexion
Couple things I do damn well
And the way that I Jack son, you figure Drake knew Sam. L
I'm for real though
I'm from Memphis, I'm often labeled as Trill so

I don't deserve, All this Love !!

My neck and wrist be shinin' in the sun
All big faces, ain’t none of these ones
Out here getting it in the California slums
Because ballin' is fun Protect yourself at all times
'Cause niggas be on Belucci and snort lines
Real life, not a movie, hard times
Gotta be aware, pay attention to your warning signs
That’s why I life live to the end, cause you never know when it’s gon' end
Er'yday my birthday, don’t worry out what I spend
Everything this hustler got, this hustler earned it
Monster, but my first name ain’t Herman
Came in the game with nothin', got out the game with somethin'
In the traffic out there rushin', in the ghetto out there hustlin'
Stacking my cho, getting my bread, strapped with the lead
They want me dead
Knocking a ho, getting some head, on a Sealy mattress bed
Took a left over from my bundle after I copped and bought a drop
Ballin' is fun, I bought it with ones, drove it up off of the lot
Went and got me some slap, and wrapped it matte black
Tinted window front and back, pint of 'gnac and the 20 sack
BIATCH! Your life is hard, times are tough
Looking for money and can’t find enough
You tried rapping, but nobody signed you up
Got some cocaine, tried to grind and stuff
Went to jail, now your time is up
Can’t get it all together 'cause your mind is fucked
Mad at the world 'cause you ride the bus
Looking out the window, wanna' ride like us
I’ma tell you something that’s good for your health
Never give up on yourself 
You never know when it’s your turn to get rich
Brand new whip with a bad lil' bitch
Hun'ed thousand dollars on your first car
Shit can really happen when you work hard
I’ma do it till I’m dead and gone
Short Dog  I’m having hella fun 16 zippers in a one pound bag
16 strippers getting down like that
Move around like that, B-La doing great
I remember out of state paying eight for grape
I remember how to stake in that DV8
Just touched back down so I’m extra straight
Got a date with an Asian, she be raisin' the bar
On half downtown and wanna fuck my car
I’m a real rap star, got the felony flow
Like to rob the bassline and fuck the melody slow
Let the melody know, oh, we gon' get rich
Bitch, listen to a pimp when he talking that shit
I put the wood in the whip, kush in the swish'
You never seen a black nigga ball like this
In every magazine I be all like this
With the 40K Roley on the wrist

Bla-blame it on tha DJ 
She wanna drop dat, den run it back 
An you can blame it on tha DJ
Bla-blame it on tha DJ I’m on like the most requested song
In his eyes, his bitch can do no wrong
In her eyes, look like she wanna jump ma balls
Give me dome, blow me like a saxaphone
When I found ma pieces fit tha ism an manipulatin
I tell her what she wanna hear an make her feel great
Tha smackology, make her feel guilty not me
When I’m wrong, I use reverse psychology
Wen am mackin an stackin madamamashin ma stash to boost up ma stats
From a little analyst into a boss savage
Who had dreams an high hopes to live rich an lavish
Survival skills, mannish right head an hustlin tactics
If it ain’t no bread involved, then I won’t be involved
Unless you’re ma relative or ma partna dawg
Ain’t a rachet type I’m a raspy type like stingy P
DJ put the record to da meat In da club goin crazy, errbody drunk
An you can blame it on d DJ

An you can blame it on d DJ
 So OG but yet so useful

I’m hella long wind, I’ll cock yo ear off
When it comes to spittin game, I’m pro
Don’t check me ma nigga, check yo ho
I’m about this paper, this playa sharp like a razor won’t save her
You wanna wife her an date her, keep her like a crusader
Evertime you pay her she pay me, you buy her a louboutin
I fucked her in ma jeep, in da backseat of ma rubican
Pussy was da bomb! Like this bubba kush
Brazillian wax not no barbara bush
Smokin an drinkin an curvin an swervin, that’s what I specialize in
I like em dark but I prefer light skin Indoor trees an tobacco leaves
Grind d weed down, no stivs no seeds
Errway I go you can smell d aroma

You’re right, I just needed som’n to rhyme wit dat line

Met this little bad bitch
She had all the Jordan shoes
Hair in a ponytail
Earrings bamboo
I said no disrespect
Girl I want a sample
She said, “You don’t know me yet”
I said, “What that got to do with it”
One week or nine months I’m still gon’ hit it
Now admit it, you’re tempted, temptation is a motherfucker
Now let your guard down
I just wanna fuck you
I’m hard right now
I put that on me
She giggled and said, “I’m full of curiosity
Well you know curiosity killed the cat
So as we walk home from school show me where you live at
Walked in, put the rubber on, then I killed that
Walked out, she hopped on the phone, girl he did that
Hm hm
Her friend on the other end thinking how she gonna get a piece of him
Preach When I get up all in ya
Tell your girlfriend I beat it up
So she can tell her friend I beat it up

Now they know who I are Yeah, it’s Ab-Soul
Used to fuck on my momma’s sofa
Them were the good old days but now a nigga older
I think back of when I chased that cat
Like a horny dog, nigga wet dreams and all
Waking up in cold sweat thinking bout them hoes, y’all
No holds barred I would go so hard
Sending bitches notes in class so much I hardly passed
Hoping she give me the mule yeah throw me that ass
I made her laugh
Maybe walk her home
Maybe get some dome
Like Super Bowl Sunday
And then I’m gone
Off to the next
Call her on the phone
This was before text
Carson High we was on them chicks”
Let them play the good role then we make them cake mix
That’s a flip if you didn’t know
Let the homie hit though
Then she tell her girlfriend, then we let her join in Wee wee wee
Wee wee wee
Wee wee weeI appreciate everyone’s support for my clothing line but I wanted to clarify a few things… The name of the line is Kanye West not DW… The DW was a design element placed on the invite in homage to my mom :-). I really appreciate the fake DW twitter page but since it’s not official I can’t co-sign any information on it
“Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.” – Leonardo Da Vinci
More clarity… I have no agency representing me currently… William Morris was fired after Cara Lewis quit. I love Cara Lewis :-)
I love being back at my fashion office learning and creating. It’s so challenging and fun and I’m surrounded by amazing people. They say you only live once but every time I come to work I feel like I’m starting a second life. You guys might think I have some type of backing for my line but I don’t. I did the first fashion show out of my own pocket and used the money I made touring to follow my passion. I’ve been working at this for 8 years now. From the first offers to do urban clothing lines that I turned down…to begging Bape to do my line and never making any real headway…to having an office in LA that was shut down after the “MTV” moment along with my tour with  Gaga
I moved to Japan for one month after that and designed every night in my room. I had this opportunity to intern at Fendi and was also offered a position at Versace which I could not take due to my contract with LV which was for 2 years. I moved to Rome after I left Japan and worked at Fendi for 4 months undercover. I was there to give ideas for the men’s collection. I snuck to Giuseppe Zanotti’s factory still under contract and learned to design womens shoes for 2 years before my first show in Paris. After doing the first LV collection I was sure I would get a second shot to create but was never given the opportunity
I designed a sneaker called the  Yeezy with Nike. I’m “allowed” to design 1 pair of sneakers every 2 years. I have more ideas…
Early 2011 I moved to Paris and opened a small design studio. The language barrier was quite difficult. I still don’t have a Paris VAT number to this day. I don’t know what a VAT is but every time I asked why we didn’t have fabrics they said it was because of the VAT. In Paris I met many great people in design including the master Azzedine Alaia. Azzedine even came by my studio one day :-). This was the greatest feeling to stand in his presence in my embarrassingly small Paris studio in a courtyard opposite Collate
I remember being 5 years old picking and my mother taking me with her shopping at the discount fur spots. She said I would always point to the most expensive furs, even as a child. LOL. There is something about making clothing that always brings me back to that point. For the first 16 or 17 years of my life the only thing I knew about women’s clothing was what my Mom would wear. I guess some critics would joke that I still don’t know anything. LOL. My Mom would wear blue jeans with a fur and an embellished “Cosby Show” sweater :-) to pick me up from school. The teachers said I couldn’t focus. I used to get kicked out of class for bringing dirty magazines and drawing Nike’s in 4th grade
Being a celebrity has afforded me many opportunities but has also boxed me in creatively. I was just discussing becoming the creative director for the Jetson movie and someone on the call yelled out, “you should do a Jetsons tour!”
This just happened a few hours ago. I was very insulted of course because for anyone that’s seen the Watch the Throne Tour, Coachella, Glow in the Dark or Runaway know that I have real ideas
I appreciate having the most nominations at the Grammy’s but I feel so conflicted by the fact that award shows sometimes are completely illogical. Good logic tells me “smile Kanye”, the world likes you again. “Red or blue pill?”…aaaaand Swallow. LOL. I wouldn’t have the prestige I have if it wasn’t partially for the Grammy's validation and I honor that
Hmmmmm, what to wear? Here I go again… Yeezy the trend setter or complete f*cking fashion victim…the verdict is still out. This is just a train of thought but I figure it’s better to read than trained thoughts
What good is fame and prestige if you can’t use it to help people? I want to help by doing what I know how to do best…create
I have started a new company and I’m so excited about the name…it’s got the best name ever…of all companies…of all time!!!
The name of the company is DONDA
DONDA is a design company which will galvanize amazing thinkers and put them in a creative space to bounce there dreams and ideas. I used to blog all the time an fit was a way to get my opinion out. Dr Dre redesigned headphones and made more impact off of one product. I am assembling a team of architects, graphic designers, directors musicians, producers, A&Rs, writers, publicist, social media experts, app guys, managers, car designers, clothing designers, DJs, video game designers, publishers, tech guys, lawyers, bankers, nutritionists, doctors, scientists and teachers
DONDA will be comprised of over 22 divisions with a goal to make products and experiences that people want and can afford. I want to put creatives in a room together with like minds that are all way doper than me. We want to help simplify and aesthetically improve everything we see hear, touch, taste and feel. To dream of, create, advertise and produce products driven equally by emotional want and utilitarian need.. To marry our wants and needs…DONDA
This will all take time but I wanted everyone’s to know what I really care about…I care about people…I care about my fans…I care about people who have never heard of me…There are over 7 billion people on the planet now…It’s something about coming from music that makes me so optimistic. Music travels and is not limited to only the wealthy. Sometimes my grammar is wrong but my thinking is right :-). My mom was an English teacher so I know she sends an SMDH from heaven :-). 5:18 am in London, my dreams keep me woke
The Watch the Throne tour was a small example of what a DONDA experience can be…
I’m currently working on a new 7 screen experience… This is one of our projects to be released this year called 2016 Olympics…It’s semi sci-fi, since 2016 is only 4 years away, :-)
We would also like to design the MTV awards. We’re taking everything 10 steps at a time, LOL! I wanted to put this in the world, in hopes that the people who can actually make a difference will stand up and reach out. We need as many amazing powerful smart talented wealthy people to be involved. Come get on board…don’t just sit there…reach out
We can collectively effect the world through design. We need to pick up where Steve Jobs left off
When I said wealthy I wanted to point out there are so many billionaires in the world that can come together and help to redesign it and help education. School systems were designed to turn people into factory workers. Schools should be designed to prep human beings for real life
Spike Jonze and I want to do a Summer school that tries new forms of curriculum. Math classes should teach addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, accounting and money management aaaaaand cut!!!
UNLESS YOU’RE A MATH MAJOR!!! Kids you should be able to take majors starting in grammar school like how it is at performing art schools. Instead of kicking kids out of schools for using their iPhones…why not promote it?
Allow kids to use search engines to do test…like the real WORLD!!! Give kids the amount of test they would have in a year in one day but they have to get everything perfect…please excuse my grammar…I know it’s extremely ironic
Some kids have better memories than others…what about emotional IQ’s? What about kids who do bad in school because of how bad their surroundings are?
Excuse me…I just get excited at the possibilities…the more excited I get the more grammatical errors you’ll see…
We need to take what Michael Jackson felt and Mcqueen and Steve Jobs, and we need make things better
When me and Jay toured, every night I peered into the audience astonished by the different walks of life that came to support us
The adrenaline is running…I don’t know if I can even get to sleep now. From Wall Street to the London riots to Chicago murders…I sit everyday and ask what can I do to make a difference. I know this is not a very rapper thing to say but I haven’t bought a new car or piece of jewelry in about 2 years
I invest every dime back into creativity, hiring amazing creatives, paying for flights, offices…etc. My area of expertise is in music, my passion is in music, design, film and products…my strength is connectivity…
There are so many broken systems from the economy to school systems to jail systems…we need experts for this. We need scientist and top world designers to directly affect governments
I just wanted to share what’s been on my mind…
“If you have an apple and I have an apple and we exchange these apples then you and I will still each have one apple…but if you have an idea and I have an idea and we exchange these ideas, then each of us will have two ideas.” – George Bernard Shaw{'Political'} Newscaster: Recently there has been an emergence of socially
Conscious and political rappers. It seems to be
A new trend in the Hip-Hop world. *DJ scratches sample* {'Nas is a rebel to America!'}3X*
 Spot build-rocker, lil' papa killed Hoffa
Beard little longer, feel strong and I'll stop ya
Drill sergeant, still thorough wheelbarrows of distilled vodka
Get me real bonkers like Will Ferrell on cat tranquilizer
Rap guys get bank and think they messiahs, but they liars
Vote fo who now? You're red, white and blue?
I'm American too, but I ain't with the president's crew
What you peddlin' and who you peddlin' to?
You ain't got the ghetto with you
Try'na lead my sheep to the slaughterhouse
Talkin 'bout +Rap the Vote+, you ain't thought about
The black vote mean nathan, who you gonna elect
Satan or Satan? In the hood nothin is changin, uh
We ain't got no choices who to choose
Ten-years ago they were tryin to stop our voices
And end Hip-Hop, they some hypocrites
Condoleeza Rice, I don't really get this chick
Tell her if she ever really cared about poor schools
About poor children, then she gotta prove that she
Ain't just another coon Uncle Tom fool
Like these MCs, gotta give 'em the rules
Lie to the youth, Uncle Tom you confused
Might as well give the Hip-Hop community a noose
Need a truce with the gangs and some food for the hungry
On Kerry nuts, he look at you like a monkey
You MCs on that old slavery path
The Bushs'll look at yo' ass and laugh
See, it's all about community, let's help ourselves
Cops brutalize us get dealt with with shells
It's our turn, it's 'bout time we win
Need somebody from the hood as my councilman, uh Yeah I think about this every day, that's the American Way, shit
Yeah I think about this every day, that's the American Way, shit
Yeah I think about this every day, that's the American Way, shit
Yeah I think about this every day, that's the American Way, shit Up in the steam room chillin', exfoliating the skin
Israeli men conversatin' on ends
Probably businessmen, I sense good taste
And they watch us, the spots an expensive place
Manhattan New York, I'm tryna keep steamin'
It's good for the lungs, had plans for the evening
This man leans in, his boys laughing
Now I'm the spokesperson for Black men, this always happens
Since all Black women care about is who got dough
And all we do is call them either bitch or a black ho
I say first brotha you ain't gotta be that cold
Since you ignorant, I'ma show you how the facts go
The biggest example in scandal of history
Were Monica Lewinksy or Donald Trump's pimping spree
Most women who love Givenchy or Gucci
Are pretentious non-Black groupies or floozies
But who are we to blame, not the dames
It's a man-made game, in essence our woman the same
Beautiful creatures, Black girls birthed the earth
So they deserve the Hermes purse
Matter fact, I'm about to go shopping with my dime
Catch you cowards the next time, the next rhyme, uh Yeah I think about this every day, that's the American Way, shit
Yeah I think about this every day, that's the American Way, shit
Yeah I think about this every day, that's the American Way, shit
Yeah I think about this every day, that's the American Way, shit I don't care about the runaways, I don't care about who's gay
I don't care about dying of AIDS, but I care if I got paid
Who even cares about the president?
I think we're making a mistake
I don't care about the hurricane as long as my family's safe
I don't care about the candidates, they burnt this country to bits
Yeah I think about this everyday, that's the American Way  Can we make a change, you know it's not overnight
Let's start the fight 
Can we make a change
You know it's not overnight
Let's start the fight 
Yeah I think about this everyday, that's the American Way {'Nas is a rebel to America!'} x 2
My neck and wrist be shinin in the sun
All big faces, ain’t none of these rude
Out here getting it in the California slum
Because ballin is fun Protect yourself at all times, cause niggas be on bellucian and snort wild
Real life, not a movie, hard times
Gotta be aware, pay attention to your warning signs
That’s why I life live to the end, cause you never know when it’s gonn end
Eryday my birthday, don’t worry out what I spend
This hustler got, this hustler earned it
Monster, but my first name ain’t Herman
Came in the game with nothing, got out the game with something
Was traffic out there rushing, in the ghetto out there hustling
Stacking my chips, eating my bread, strapped with the lead
They want me dead
Knocking hoe, getting some head, on a ceiling mattress bed
Took a left over from my bundle after I copped and bought a drop
More and it’s fun, I bought it with 1’s, drove it off of the lot
Wind got me some slap, and wrapped in mat black
Tinted window front and back, Pontiac, in the 20 sack  x 2
My neck and wrist be shinin in the sun
All big faces, ain’t none of these rude
Out here getting it in the California slum
Because ballin is fun Your life is hard, times are tough, looking for money, you can’t find enough
You try rapping, but nobody signed you up
Got some cocaine, try to grind and stuff
Went to jail, now your time is up
Can’t get it all together cause your mind is fucked
Mad at the world cause you ride the bus
Looking out the window, wanna ride like us
I’ma tell you something that’s good for your health
Never give up on yourself
You never know when it’s your turn to get rich
Brand new whip with a bad lil bitch
Hunned thousand dollars on your first car
Shit can really happen when you work hard
I’ma do it till I’m dead and gone, short dog, what you doing
I’m having hella fun  x 2
My neck and wrist be shinin in the sun
All big faces, ain’t none of these rude
Out here getting it in the California slum
Because ballin is fun 16 zippers in a one pound bag, 16 strippers getting down like that
Moving round like that, beaver doing great
I remember I was state pen ache for great
I remember how the stake and that vva
Just touched back down so I’m extra straight
Got a date with an asian she be register bar
On half down town, wanna fuck my car
I’m a real rap star, got the felony flow
Like I robed the baseline and fucked the melody slow
...you know, oh we gonn get right
Bitch listen to a pimp when he talking that shit
I keep the wood in the whip, kush in the swish
You never seen a black nigga ball like this
In every magazine I be all like this
With the 40k rollie on the wrist  x 2
My neck and wrist be shinin in the sun
All big faces, ain’t none of these rude
Out here getting it in the California slum
Because ballin is fun

I mind fucked an intellectual
Had sex with her on my sectional
Slowed it down, take it extra slow
Bust on myself like Plaxico
Oh alright here I go
Shorty got my love in the finger fold
I got a manicure, pedicure
I got her hair done and credit card new
I'm balling on her big time
Told shorty I'm 6'5
Stand up on my bankroll, make me look like I'm 6'9
She look like she been fine
She always call me big time
Pinky ring on, you should see the way I sip wine
I'm maestro in the main suite
Make a side chick out your main squeeze
Better hop on board 'fore the train leave
Shorty outta place cause I slang D
And I'm changes need my chain freeze
Meant to say my chain froze
Everytime I change clothes Cherish the game
When we fly far away
Sky dive in a puddle of mud
Make it rain blue dolphin
All I see is blue dolphin
 I like when she smile
She like when I make her smile
She like when I put it down
She like when I come in town
I like when she on the brown
She like when I'm on the loud
Seen her take some coke then smile
Seen her take a perc then pow
Birkin bag see no salt
All on the beach with toes out
All on the beach sea gulls out
All in the jeep windows down
Where I come from the Regals out
She knows I turn up on the molly
She doing string thing for money
I'm trying to put it in her tummy
I might whisper in her earlobe
I'm blowing kisses in her earlobe
I'm telling things she ain't built for
Money long as Lincoln Continentals
Codeine with a touch of Sprite
Geeked up for a hundred nights
I'm a roll had a Cuban link
In a figaro this a finger roll  
3 Chainz, oww Caught up in my bullshit, put your head on backwards
And skate off after, engage in laughter 'bout what just happened
Fingers in napkins get sent to mammies, is that too graphic?
Catch you in traffic, you sitting Daffy like stealing candy
My ceiling’s absent, my wheels are massive, my friends assassins
All of us bastards, our mothers queens and our women dancers
My rivers rapid, my fins are splashin’, my gills are flappin’
I bit some matches then sipped some gas and went kiss a dragon I’m really rappin’, no finger snappin’, I’m pistol packin’
Y’all niggas slippin’, my swag is drippin’, so here’s a napkin
What’s really happnin’ bro? Verbal attackin’, I’m showing passion
Know what I mean, see I’m the king like I’m from Akron
I’m going overboard, somebody call the captain
And when it come to getting checks, I always want the fat ones
I’m so high I can sing to a chandelier
My flow a glass of Ace of Spade and yours a can of beer Too many bitches, too many blunts, too many buttons
Not enough bullets, them niggas buggin’, the SWAT is comin’
AK on shoulder, no shoulder shruggin', aim at ya nugget
My weed sticky like acupuncture and magnets, honey
Knock on the side door three times and have your money
Or get to steppin' like Kappas stompin', I'll slap a junkie
I’m having lunch with Italian Sonny, don’t ask the subject
Lord, why you took Rabbit from me? He say, Don't ask me nothing
Too many bodies, too many bangers, too many bundles
Not enough bullets, these niggas buggin', I heard they stung you
It’s gon' be trouble, we come through and catch you while you cuddle
Them shotgun barrels like tunnels nigga, don't even mumble I’m back to ballin', I'm in the back full of magnums only
Pull on the scene and I fuck your queen playing Pastor Troy
Our weed ready, turkey spaghetti and caster oil
That's codeine, turn your guillotine to a fashion show
In four minutes I'll turn this into forensics
In a foreign car with a foreign broad that’s long winded
Paper long and you taking long, you just don't get it
Hung the phone up on Satan, told me he want a song with me
Hotter than Mississippi in summer of 1950s
In a van full of some niggas and white bitches
Get pulled over for swervin’ like, Hi, officer
When he ask me why I was swerving, I’m high, officer I can make it bounce by myself
I can make it bounce by myself
I can make it bounce by myself
I can make it bounce by myself
I can make it bounce by myself
I can make it bounce by myself
I can make it bounce by myself
I can make it bounce by myself Got a mansion, a condo, a cabin, I sleep in my Phantom
So high dancing with the stars to the Star Spangled Banner
I change your channel, I change your pattern, I ring your Saturn
I bang your madam, she get on top and I shake the ladder
I make her straddle then gather and calculate the data
I listen up for the snakes or the baby rattle
I play the shadows, don’t play no games, I straight get at ‘em
I’m on the chronic all day like it’s my favorite album A plate of salmon, the Cayman Islands, a stripper dancer
If I don’t get the car first, I’ll have a temper tantrum
I’m innovative, I demonstrated, this nickle plated
I don’t care if you owe me a nick, nigga you need to pay me
I kiss ya lady, eat her pussy then kiss the baby
Get situated, get keys off table then leave her 80
I really made it, get it maid, Schwarzenegger
Won’t wrestle niggas, I spatula all you action figures I’m so high the blunt feel like a dumbbell
These niggas tiny like a spider on a Spud Webb
I got some upscale cocaine on my thumbnail
I feed it to my fun girls, they say fuck yeah I’m doing this shit like whatever
When I go I’mma leave for the better
I told her you dig like a shovel
I want a Ferrari in yellow
Just so I can match all my yellow bitches
I been a playa since elementary
I got more bars than a penitentiary
I got a clip that hang several inches I can make it bounce by myself
I can make it bounce by myself
I can make it bounce by myself
I can make it bounce by myself
I can make it bounce by myself
I can make it bounce by myself
I can make it bounce by myself
I can make it bounce by myselfHook

Across the street you was wildin'

Left the hospital that same night, what
Got my gat back, time to backtrack
I had the drop so how the fuck I get clapped
Black was in the Jeep watchin all these scenes speed by
It was a brown Datsun, and yo nobody in my hood got one
That clown cat's through, blazin at his crew I can't believe it achieve
Yo Cormega whatever whatever whatever Pushin' a red lex
With many screams inside the headsets
So much beef, police surprised I ain't dead yet
I keep red tech in the passenger seat
To match their heat
It's so real if I don't see you I'm splashing your beep
It's on the kid
Whoever gets his first
It's going to kids dirt
My soldiers be cold blooded vultures
And cold blooded
Yo on the street we control hundreds

Mahogany complexion
Body probably dressed in
My ill tommy hill collection
When I be flexin', sketch it
My selection of words are type effective
When I rhyme words are verbalized remain present
In mines, I'm like an with air macs nikes on
Recite nice on mics strike like a python
My gold chain with ice on lookin' trife on
My Jacuzzi filled with tight warm relaxed lookin steaming
Lounging like a falcon on a mountain top at Egypt
Cats schemin when they see my rocks gleaming
Mega shine forever rhyme wicked like a demon
Where my charcoal, new balance a lot yo
The narcs go knocked my man Marco
His money was marked yo
I regulate a sharp flow
But in my life bucaso
My mom died when I was five and never left my heart yo
I symbolize rive alive niggas
Ghetto's where I live
Considered my rhyme the oasis
Because rap was a desert
And I helped minds escaped it
Yo Nas link it up it's like an ill typed bracelet Fake thug, no love
You get the slug, CB4 Gusto
Your luck low

You freak cats get played out
Get robbed and laid out
Prostitute turned snitch
I got the gauge out
96 ways I made out, Montana way
The Good-F-E-L-L-A, verbal AK spray
Dipped attache, jumped out the Range

I'm like Al Pacino
God bless the life of my man nino It's sort of like the conclusion to Color Purple
Brothas is losing, confusion, with one time all pursuit moves in
Grabbing niggas up in this movement to rule shit
Cop verses the block, shorties is too quick
Lesson number one. If you're arrested and hung
Where Brothas is from gotta keep a lid on your tongue
It's like silent murder, I hit blunts hard like Ray Mercer
The violent words of a prince in a palace of Persia
The cognac plurger plus the trees
But whose the faul one to make his nose take a freeze
And got enough gold to rock ice in all hype
Used to be a general but just lost his stripe
Pipe dreams and white feinds and all-nighters, collect calls from lifers
Astoria walls with cypress, but yo that's another subject
I love teks let's get it off
Yo what up what up Yo funkmaster flex you know I got the ill lex
I wear my guests in apendix
And cash my cheque in flesh shit
My man escobar be lighting a weed
And I proceed with all the ill types of rhymes you need
I'm not the new jack, or crew rack I'm like the next man
Cormega, I just got signed to Def Jam
My man Nas is down with me
A lot of sucker rappers they can't diss me
It's like that, you know it's like that
We'll strike back Queensbridge style

Queensbridge
Mama, MAMA!

Skrrr, skrrr, skrrr, skrrr, skrrr: hit it with the fork
Skrrr, skrrr, skrrr, skrrr, skrrr: hit it with the fork
Rap don't work, records ain't bein' sold
So much money on me, it won't even fold
So much money on me, it won't even fold
So much money on me, it won't even fold
So much money on me, it won't even fold
So much money on me, it won't even fold I got Medusa on my sneakers

When I'm sipping on that codeine
Free my nigga Sigel
Ridin' on a jet, headin' to that Costa
Soon as I land I be in that Testarossa
If I die tonight, you gon' see some flexin' ghostas
I'm the man in my city, same thing in South Dakota
Man I'm running up that check, show you how I do it
I drink red bitches, I don't drink Red Bulls
Man they tried to give me wings, but I already had some
I'm all that and then some, my trap house is my income
And it's booming I had a dream, rap wouldn't work
Woke up on the block, hit it with the fork
Skrrr, skrrr, skrrr: hit it with the fork
Skrrr, skrrr, skrrr: hit it with the fork
Rap don't work, records ain't bein' sold

All gold in my amenities
2 Chainz, two pinky rings
My trigger finger's like a lemon squeeze 
Climax! Make your main ho my side-chick
I'm so high, your whore get hijacked
And my vision is Pyrex
I do it big like a 5X
Killed they ass with the eyepatch
I got bad bitches on my side
I done fucked around and got sidetracked
My first night, I spent five stacks
Next night I forgot to count
I'm so hot; who gon' put the fire out?
I'm the fireman, I put fire out
Got a pole in my basement
Tipped your girl like Maliah now
Ridin' on these motherfucka's until they blow my tires out, uh My wrist deserve a shout-out, I'm like What up, wrist?
My stove deserve a shout-out, I'm like What up, stove?
All this jewelry on then I'm out cold
So much money on me, it won't even fold! I had a dream, rap wouldn't work
Woke up on the block, hit it with the fork
Skrrr, skrrr, skrrr: hit it with the fork
Skrrr, skrrr, skrrr: hit it with the fork
Rap don't work, records ain't bein' sold
So much money on me, it won't even fold
So much money on me, it won't even fold
So much money on me, it won't even fold
I guess I get mad when you get boxed in
So mad, you wanna start boxin'
So mad, you gonna turn to Tyson
Slicin' and dicin'
Paparazzi, I'm like a Nazi to 'em
I'm not Bill Cosby to 'em
And I ain't Bing Crosby
More like  to 'em
Aye yo, I've got to ruin
The image and the style that you're used to doin'
When people usually do music
I am a visionary, Christian soldier, don't confuse it
Before I lose it and have to prove it
This the way that we gon', time; we gotta move it to the future
Karma Sutra, any way that suit ya
Don't shoot ya, stop the violence and it's been stopped
We stopped the violence in the hip-hop
We stopped the hatin' and the degradation
We 'bout to build like One Nation
Got off the phone with Benjamin Carson
Uh, that's the next president, arson
Burn it down, burn Hollywood, burn like Ice Cube said
I'm the rudest, a lot of people say that
Cause they say, Ye, don't play that
They be off that Grey Goose, I be off that Ye Juice
That's the way I stay loose
Confidence and esteem, American dream
My crib's spatial and my relationship is interracial I don't know where to start, I don't know where to start
Maybe the chart, maybe the heart
Maybe the flow, maybe the gold
Where I was grown, what I grew up in
Well, you see, my mama divorced my daddy
And moved my family when I was 3
And in the cold, straight from Chicago where I go
And everybody know, from my homie Don C, I be air
Aye, yo, like IBM or Apple, Steve Jobs of this
Yeah, I'm on my job with this
Aye, yo, it's very, very simple
You heard me on Jimmy Kimmel, I can do it every tempo
I'll use my temple
I wanna build a temple, I wanna build churches
That could be as big as The Adam's Family's, where Lurch is
Aye, yo, this is not a circus
The zoo is closed, motherfuckers
It ain't no cursin' in the verse which you know is not perfect
And now you know it's still worth it
I might short-circuit, I might just black out
Hit you with that BLOCKA!
You know I'm Ibaka
Number One Chief Rocker, Number One Chief Rocker
Ain't nobody gon' stop him, ain't nobody gon' stop us
Because God on my side, that's the way I ride
Jesus Christ, Yeezus nice! One time I had lost my faith
But I had to stay faithful and grateful for the God I was given
The way that I was livin' or the life that I've been livin'
It didn't make a difference
See, when I was 30, I had 6 parents
Grandmother, grandfather, grandmother, grandfather
Mother, father, now I've only got one parent
Life could change in a blink, and that is apparent
But still you've got to stay strong
I don't know what everybody else is on
Sometimes I don't listen to music, I just need to zone out
Sometimes I don't listen to music, everybody clones now
And I doubt they even listen, and I ain't tryna diss 'em
But sometimes I be in music and feel like it's a prison
And everybody say bein' a rockstar is everything
But see, I wanna do everything
And I know I could do everything
And be anything that I wanna be
So simply, if you wanna be like Mike
I wanna be like Christ, I wanna be that nice
You know what I'm saying?
Okay, this beat just threw me off
Took it extra old-school
This ain't no freestyle beat, yo, yo, dude!Ohh, ohh, oh, ohh, ohh

Complexion don't mean a thing 
Complexion 
It all feels the same  Dark as the midnight hour or bright as the mornin' sun
Give a fuck about your complexion, I know what the Germans done
Sneak 
Sneak me through the back window, I’m a good field nigga
I made a flower for you outta cotton just to chill with you
You know I'd go the distance, you know I'm ten toes down
Even if master listenin', cover your ears, he 'bout to mention Complexion 
Complexion don't mean a thing 
Oh, Complexion 
It all feels the same  Dark as the midnight hour, I'm bright as the mornin' sun
Brown skinned, but your blue eyes tell me your mama can't run
Sneak 
Sneak me through the back window, I’m a good field nigga
I made a flower for you outta cotton just to chill with you
You know I'd go the distance, you know I'm ten toes down
Even if master's listenin', I got the world's attention
So I'ma say somethin' that's vital and critical for survival
Of mankind, if he lyin', color should never rival
Beauty is what you make it, I used to be so mistaken
By different shades of faces
Then Whit' told me, A woman is woman, love the creation
It all came from God, then you was my confirmation
I came to where you reside
And looked around to see more sights for sore eyes
Let the Willie Lynch theory reverse a million times with... Complexion 
Complexion don't mean a thing 
Oh, Complexion 
It all feels the same  You like it, I love it
You like it, I love it
You like it, I love it
You like it, I love it
You like it, I love it
You like it, I love it
You like it, I love it
You like it, I love it
(Where the homegirl Rapsody at?
I need you to speak your mind real quick, loved one!) Let me talk my Stu Scott, ‘scuse me on my 2Pac
Keep your head up, when did you stop loving thy
Color of your skin? Color of your eyes
That’s the real blues, baby, like you met Jay’s baby
You blew me away, you think more beauty in blue, green and grey
All my solemn men up north, 12 years a slave
12 years of age, thinkin' my shade too dark
I love myself, I no longer need Cupid
Enforcin' my dark side like a young George Lucas
Light don’t mean you smart, bein' dark don’t make you stupid
And frame of mind for them bustas, ain’t talkin' “Woo-hah!”
Need a paradox for the pair of doc's they tutored
Like two Todd's, L-L, you lose two times
If you don’t see you beautiful in your complexion
It ain’t complex to put it in context
Find the air beneath the kite, that’s the context
Yeah, baby, I’m conscious, ain’t no contest
If you like it, I love it, all your earth tones been blessed
Ain’t no stress, jiggaboos wanna be
I ain’t talkin' Jay, I ain’t talkin' Bey
I’m talkin' days we got school watchin' movie screens
And spike your self esteem
The new James Bond gon' be black as me
Black as brown, hazelnut, cinnamon, black tea
And it’s all beautiful to me
Call your brothers magnificent, call all the sisters queens
We all on the same team, blues and pirus, no colors ain’t a thing Barefoot babies with no cares
Teenage gun toters that don’t play fair, should I get out the car?
I don’t see Compton, I see something much worse
The land of the landmines, the hell that’s on earth

Y'all be doin' too much
Running your mouths
Fuckin shit up, you gotta get up
Cus I done had enough
Getting sick and tired of the same stuff
You told Kamil and she told Karla
And she told April and now they all know
But I could give a fuck 'cus all y'all my hoes
So, all that confronting the real nigga on site
Today is today, last night was last night
As I leaned with my hand on my balls
I had to really check these bitches and tell 'em like this dog  Nina do this and Tina do that
Sabrina, Sakina, nigga them all my hood rats
Back in the days when I was on the block
At an early age man, I was on the cock
Non-stop, I beat it up and tell that bitch to get ghost

Hollarin' out, poppin' a collar out
And talkin' shit on the phone to me at my baby-mama's house
 Look here bitch do you know who the fuck I am
You better read your motherfuckin' press telegram
You remind me of this bitch that used to work for me
Had to cut the bitch up 'cus she tried to get too close to me
And tried to confront me at a club one night
Fuckin' with her friend, a fake bitch 
But you know I had to stop and I paused
And I put my hand on my balls and said check this out, dog  I got my own spot and I got my own keys
So can't no bitch talk shit to me
Like Kiki did me, bitch changed the locks
And kicked me up outta spot
I learned a lesson, I wasn't guessin' or stressin'
I got another bitch and she was at the convalescent home
She said she needed a companion
Shit I needed a chaperone plus a new home
Snap, crack, it's on
But in no time at all seems she fell in love
But I wasn't ready for that
Topcat had to scat
I hit her friend from the back
While she was at work workin'
I was jerkin' that skirt
And fuckin with all her friends that was flirtin'
And when she found out she told me that that shit hurt 
A week later she fucked my homeboy Kurt
Bitch you a'int shit but dirt for dirt 
This is a sexy bitch {*Music fades out*}
What, tssh, y'all, what
Jigga, uhh uhh uhh, uh-huh
Pa-pa, uhh, pa-pa, uhh
The G, Roc-A-Fella y'all Who be, in a Japanese restaurant, eating sushi
Drinking sake, it's me, and my mami with the doobie
Cutie, smelling like Miyake, half-Philippine thing
For now, let's call her Suki, got me, this booty banging
Properly, in Versace pants, cocky bow-legged stance
A thing of beauty, watch me, body crazy
Tits Firm like Nature, Foxy, Nas and AZ
Truly reason to bug the toolie and keep laced in jewelry, watch me
Girlie tried to lure me and lock me you gotta get up early
'Cause who's getting played is not me
Surely you jest, she said, if you thought I was purely
Out for the bucks you woulda bucked stuck and dropped me
I said maturely, You right
But better safe than sorry, before the lovebirds
Can move to the suburbs, I need to double check your story
To make sure that you one of a kind
And you deserve to be my Sunshine Touch me with, a heart of gold 
I can't go a day without my sunshine 
Touch me with, a smile of gold 
I can't go a day without my sunshine, sunshine  A year gone, and she seeing things most chicks only
Hear in songs , keep in gear phenom
Lots of ice in the air, round the neck the charm 
Risked a four to life bid to keep that shit on her arm
Keep her impressed at all times, cats would love to creep 
Just to say they crept with mine, slept with mine, she said I ain't deaf nor blind, niggas stressing
Hating 'cause they less than mine, they wanna sex me
We chose each other, you acting like you chose me
They oppose you then, they oppose me
We could creep at a low speed, the gat in the hosiery
Double cross you they got to triple cross me
 Uh-huh
(One more thing:
If I ever go broke, would you hit the block for me?) Fo' sho'
 Uhhhh
 I put that on my life

I can't go a day without my sunshine 
Touch me with, a smile of gold 
I can't go a day without my sunshine, sunshine 
Catch a case you catch it with me? 
Pawn your jewelry to come get me? 
Catch me with a chick, forgive me? 
They spread rumors, will you defend me, tooth and nail? 
They try to frame me, will you be there, till the truth prevail? 
(But would you be the same dude, when you blow the roof off sales
That you was, throwin' rocks, at the roof at 12, nigga?)
This is the truth I shall, 'til the loot gets frail
I put this on my nephews, from the smallest to the pale
Me and you balling, from the Heavens, or the Hell
Won't let you hit the ground if I'm falling myself
Now picture me leaving you in this cold world, rolling for delf
It's me and you in this old girl, we taking the belt
From the lows, to the highs, to the foes we shine
Just continue to be my Sunshine, uhh Touch me with, a heart of gold 
I can't go a day without my sunshine 
Touch me with, a smile of gold 
I can't go a day without my sunshine, sunshine 
Touch me with, a heart of gold
I can't go a day without my sunshine, ahh-haaa
Touch me with, a smile of gold
I can't go a day without my sunshine, sunshine
Some of 'em lie about the shit they got and what they do on the block
Some of 'em lie about the guns they pop
But I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't
That's how it is for me cause I live a boss' life
So many niggas wanna play but still got dues to pay
Some of 'em gotta beg a bitch to stay
But I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't
That's how it is for me cause I live a boss' life
Now this is for the B's and the C's, and the D's and the H's
And the G's puttin work in overseas
At ease with the Doggy and smoke some weed
Fuck it, if my nigga detoxing, it's more for me
Baby this is presidential really, a pocket full of women
Understanding how I'm living, show them hoes how you winning
It's the beginning with the pearls you're given
The world soft like linen and sweet like cinnamon
But everyday like 50 say, it's Many Men
They wanna take me out the spot, they want the pussy and the ends
But separate the paper and the Benz and the cribs
Then the hoes, then the clothes, I'mma have to let 'em go
You know how the Dogg roll, don't get it twisted
Cause he bang out the East just in case you wanna visit
A touch of the exquisite, mixed with somethin pimpish
And it's comin from the Beach where them niggas is a beast
But I just listen, all that shit is in my past
I'm connected to the purse first nigga, the ass last
From Long Beach to Venice is the premise
Want the green like spinach and I'm strong to the finish See me man, I'm nothin like you
I got the kinda swagger that you ain't used to
I'm leanin in my ride, fo' fifth, cock bangin
Me, I'm ridin by ya on the corner, block slangin
I'm livin that boss' life
The hoes come runnin when they see me comin
I'm livin that boss' life
You can have anything just don't fuck with my money This is for the West and the East and the Dirty South
Khaki's and them Timbs and them niggas with the platinum mouths
Thinkin that they blessed by the actions that be comin out
When you in Magic City you be carrying a lot of clout
But trickin ain't the route, that's even if you got it
There's a method to you holdin it when they can't do without it
Just put the key up in it nigga if she 'bout it
You can have her and her partner, fuckin with it for a dolla
If she a baller, she gon' ride with a shot caller
Roll with the Boss Dogg in the back of a blue Impala
And if she follow, then she gon' swallow
All the game you got to give her, be a different bitch tomorrow
But I would never bother breakin out the Doggfather
'less I knew that she was 'bout him, havin diamonds on his collar
I'm just an author, spreading game to my partners
Walkin on the blue carpet with the Doctor  For the record, I used to do a lot of humping when I was little
I got a lot of whoopings over that shit too, and that's random, but so what? Ha-ha Gimme that beat fool, this a full time jack
No really this a Sounwave track
So really I ain't gotta steal nothing all I gotta do is kill it
When you press record button let the paralyzed feel it
I came back with a full time swag
And the critics thought they had me
Nah, I just bought more batteries
Turned up supercharged, a medium away from living large
Matter fact where my niggas at?
Where my bitches with them pretty weaves?
Enemies bleed on the maxi pad, pussy you fucked with the wrong one
I'm on one, I'll make sure your kids breathe pneumonia
Good kid, mad city evil in my heart
From the blood niggas fucking with me, crip niggas tryna kill me
Malcolm X mind state, if I raise the crime rate
It's a legitimate reason why
I put on repeat Kanye's Touch the Sky
But I'll be looking past that I'm tryna touch God
My heart to the heavens, the rebel of the reverend
Y'all married to the game well I'm 'bout to crash weddings
I put a lot of pain in the shit I write
If you going through something, this the shit you recite
This is bigger than life, this is Kendrick Lamar
This is Jimi Hendrix guitar on tour, bonjour, I mean war like that!
Yeah, straight like that People don't be shy
Release them balloons to the sky
I need the world to celebrate me! 
You'll never know when I'm gone  In 2010, I'm tryna ball, nigga!
Like shooting jumpshots in the mall, nigga!
That's a quote from Ab-Soul
I suppose since you laugh that's the ultimate goal
On behalf of the Top Dawg conglomerate, shall stay anonymous
Searching seven continents accomplishing big shit
Big ass, big tits she on me
And just to get to me she'll fuck the homies... homie's homies
The life of a cool nigga, my nigga Tony said
Just do you, nigga! Show and prove, nigga
And they gon' play you for a fool that's for sure
'til they know you got the stinkiest stool, nigga!
I ain't tripping I'm just tipping on fo-fo's
Back in the city and tipping on four hoes
That boy got a cold cold, he's sick con, slick on
Dropin red jewels like a school bar mitzvah, ooh
Straight like that Why y'all complain about OG's?
I don't look at a legend and say you owe me
Not Snoop, not Dre, not Ice Cube
I don't care me and Quik went to the same school
I look in the mirror and do it myself
Like a self made nigga, I don't need a maid, nigga
Do I need a co-sign from Dre or Jigga?
They can make me much bigger
But do I need 'em though?, I just need a flow
The type of shit that make you think you seen Pac ghost
Me Against The World on you mothafuckas
I got my back against the wall and a .45, dog get smoked, Chris Tucker
Uhh, tryna record my steelo
Even when I'm not there just like TiVo
The hoes tell me that I got a real big ego
And weed move slow right now but E go
You know what I'm talking 'bout? I look at your Audemars
To put ya'll in time out, it's time to unveil the real
And your career is about as frail as Ms. Winehouse
Just salute, grab a flute, and pull the wine out, ooh
Just like that 
Alcoholism Pull this bitch over my nigga, I gotta piss
I stay with some sip in my fist, I drink like a fish
Sometimes I be sober, but most the times I be blitzed
I'm having my Gouda, my nigga all on her bitch
We ball like we hoopers, my nigga we hood-rich
We winning not losing, my fella we got chips
I keep me a stapler, a pistol-grip four-fifth
Cuz I'd rather be judged by 12 then to be carried by 6
Don't wanna be carried by 6, I Rather be judged by 12
Suckas be all in my mix, Cuz I be up in their gal
Don't know how to read, write and spell
But I can add and count scrill
I can sell a rocks to a cliff
I can sell oil to a well
Yay area reppin, don't need no swagger injection
Big Oceans Eleven, hustling and money collecting
I'm shattered, I'm blended mayne, I been chiefing the seven
The po po's they tripping mane, they sobriety checking The fur furs is crazy, Lucky I have me a desi
A designated driver, a rider, we in it heavy
We knocking 40 Water, he foolish the boy gone
That's all they played was his music when I was in a group home
Bout to go slap some bones, shoot some dominoes with my fellas
Get on that Patron, called Stella Ella and Della
10 to get on the board, I'm fresh off the top
If I skunk you my ninja, you gotta drink two shots
Or we can play for some fedi, or we can play for pushups
Or we can put on the gloves, go from the shoulders box
After that we can hug get a room get props
All my fellas is thugs, ballheads dreadlocks
Slide out to the function, and continue to get bent
Last weekend it was smacking, my nigga that shit went
I left outta there with not one but two women
I guess you can blame it mayne on that alcoholism 13-hundred block ready rock animal
Sitting in the coupe, Orange like cantaloupe, something on the manifold
Gears in the rear, Olde English beer make it hard to steer
I been getting fucked up since the 9th-10 grade
Bird and grape Kool-Aid no ace of spades
I swerved and I do thangs I dance in the rain
And I guess this the money we gain the champagne
I pulls in the lot, bullets in the Glock
Hot boy or not B-lit like to shoot shots
Stop where I'm hot and I like to drink shots
And I'm gone off the Julio at the 20th what not
You can say what you say, Imma paper boy
Little waves up top, with the table boy
She be playing hard to get, but you can make them boy
Put some drink in her cup and watch her swish it up Please drink responsibly don't drink and drive
Past hoes, comin' back in the present

The allure of breaking the law
Was always too much for me to ever ignore
I've got a thing for the big-body Benzes, it dulls my senses
In love with a V-Dub engine
Man, I'm high off life, fuck it, I'm wasted
Bathing Ape kicks, Audemars Piguet wrist
My womenfriends get tennis bracelets
Trips to Venice, get their Winters replaced with
The sun...it ain't even fun no more, I'm jaded
Man, it's just a game, I just play it to play it
I put my feet in the footprints left to me
Without saying a word, the ghetto's got a mental telepathy
My brother hustled so - naturally -
Up next was me...but what perplexes me
Shit, I know how this movie ends! yet still I play
The starring role in Hovito's Way In the valley of my world
You'll be my only girl
Once again it's the life, Oh no!
In the valley of my world
You'll be my only girl
Once again it's the life, Oh no! I'm like a Russian mobster, drinking distilled vodka
Until I'm under the field with Hoffa...it's real
Peel the top up like a toupée
Mix the water with the soda
Turn the pot up, make a soufflé
All of y'all can get it like group-page on your 2-way
I'm living proof that crime do pay
Say hooray to the bad guy, and all the broads
Putting cars in their name, for the stars of the game
Putting 'caine in their bras and their tomorrows on the train:
All in the Name of Love
Just to see that love locked in chains and the family came
Over the house to take back everything that they claimed
Or even the worse pain is the distress
Learning you're the mistress only after that love gets slain
And the anger and the sorrow mixed up leads to mistrust
Now it gets tough to ever love again
But the allure of the game, keeps calling your name
To all the Lauras of the world, I feel your pain
To all the Christies in different cities and Tiffany Lanes:
We all hustlers in love with the same thing I'm like Pookie in New Jack, cleaned up with the roof back
On the other side of the tracks I produce crack
Still a fiend no less, for the green i just
Go through a thing I guess, brings out my best
Brings out my worse, just the gift and the curse
No one said it would be easy, nigga livin is work
It's hard to not style in the Arnage, or fuck the Arnage
When the Benz doors lift up from the floor
And every night fake willies wanna match ya ball
But I'm far out of reach like Abdul-Jabbar
I'm so into this life, you know who I are
Every corner, every hood, nigga ghetto superstar
It's the life 
Hey nigga I was in Oakland, Oakland like Brooklyn
Short! Dawg! Bay area!!!
They showed me so much love when I was down there I had to get hyphy on this one Uh! Ask my nigga Lebron!
We so big we ain't gotta respond
When you talkin to a don
Please have respect like your talkin to your mom
We let the money do the talkin
As you see we be talkin rather often 
The ROC Boys in the buildin
Another hundred fifty million don't it sound like we yellin?!!!
Who the fuck overrated?!
If anything they underpaid him
Hatin that's only 'gon make him spend the night
Out of spite with the chick you've been datin
We the best of the best
We 'gon be here so the rest could take a rest
I gotta get this off my chest
No pause none of that shit, get off my dick!!!! BLOW THE WHISTLE!!!
BLOW THE WHISTLE!!!
BLOW THE WHISTLE!!! 
BLOW THE WHISTLE!!! Hold up, I gotta keep it real
It's gonna take seven movies by Will 
Seven movies by twenty mil'
And you still ten short from what I did with one deal 
Don't compare me to nobody
I'd rather not be mentioned, I'm offended
Unless you talkin Sinatra, James Dean or
John Lennon  or Jimi Hendrix
I'm just a rock star, BEEYITCH!!
Keep it real, you know I got y'all BEEYITCH!!
We ain't in the same league
You could lie to yourself, you can't lie to me 
I don't even know y'all name
I'm too big for ya, the rap Lebron James
Roc Nation, the new movement
And y'all money funny, what the fuck are YOOOU DOING??
I don't know what y'all on
This is chess, know the difference 'tween the king and the pawn BLOW THE WHISTLE!!!
BLOW THE WHISTLE!!!
BLOW THE WHISTLE!!!
BLOW THE WHISTLE!!!
Blow the whistle!
Amazing man, got a letter from an Asian fan
He asked, was I black, was I gon' play Japan soon?
Wrote back, Yes danced in the shower, got dressed
Old school, powdered my neck
I give, but I'm selfish
Tattoo of my chick lips on my pelvis
Well it's the pubic part, excuse me y'all
I think that I became musical
Way before rap I did wanna be the tap dance kid
On Broadway, 42nd Street, legendary
Three-card Molly, Nasir drives a Harley now
FYI, for your info
Insects splattered on the bike window
Tatted innuendo
Just last night, don't know where it came from
Guess it's from a past life
Am I charismatic enough?
Does my charm reach people that could make a change?
If I shoot with straight aim at the positive target
And swooed 'em to make a deposit into my account
Would that be progress?
I doubt Something is fishy, something is bothering me
I just can't figure it out
Something right under my tongue, I can't speak it
Can't spell it, yo it's bugging me out
Somebody doin' something wrong to somebody I know
Somehow it's related to me and now I'm frustrated
Cause now I'm focusing too hard
On something that's just too plain to see Savoir faire yeah radiate, conscience clear
About to have a monstrous year
Live in the spot, yeah, err night, deep
Ladies, get ya harder than termite teeth
C'est la vie, I'm engaged
But the crew came to play, they fly free, check me
And they wrist is froze, like toes on a body in the morgue
That was put there by the squad
Look here, I'm the God on the mic on the track
Like Arthur Ashe with a tennis rack, tell the DJ, spin it back
{*beat reverses*}
Yeah, somethin' like that
Uh, it go
Savoir-faire yeah, radiate, conscience clear
About to have a monstrous year
Live in the spot, yeah, err night, deep
Ladies, get ya harder than termite teeth
C'est la vie, I'm engaged
But the crew came to play, they fly free, check me
And they wrist is froze, like toes on a body in the morgue
They were all put there by the squad
Look here, I'm the god on the mic on the track
Like Arthur Ash on the tennis rack, tell the, nah
Everything I be in
Creme de la creme from the linen to the gold front rim
Cold stuntin'
Take a look around, what you found?
Like Master Ace, tell me the world's a faster place
High school students will slash your face
And these white nigga hoods, I'm talkin'
Computer rage is real
Get excited when I'm walkin'
Cause I'm used to dark shades and a limousine tint
Business managers scare me half to death
When they tell me every month what is  being spent Something is fishy, something is bothering me
I just can't figure it out
Something right under my tongue, I can't speak it
Can't spell it, yo it's bugging me out
Somebody doin' something wrong to somebody I know
Somehow it's related to me and now I'm frustrated
Cause now I'm focusing too hard
On something that's just too plain to see I don't like when my girl try to pull a MC Lyte
Jumped out the whip, through the train
Leave me like D Nice
They say we used to resemble each other
Both last name Jones so we must be brothers
My yearly salary suffers
Cause I hate work, no play make Jack lame
And I rock parts on my head that are hotter than yours
Hot rosado lines, designs your barber can't draw
Posters of Nas on the barbershop doors
Entourage, security galore
When was the last time you rode by yourself, superstar?
Got so much love I shot Cupid in the heart
I'm awakened by my own screams
Lucifer masturbated in my dreams
It means somebody is gonna get fucked in the worst way
And none of y'all hoes touchin' my wordplay
Janitors and men with eighty mil both feel the same grief
The men at work, blue collars of the old men
Shinin' shoes, shoe polish go through the same dramas
They wish for a better tomorrow
I thought only five percenters are conspiracy theorists
Thinkin' what the new world order thing is
But everybody does
The fear of the planet is contaminatin everybody's blood
Triliteral, Democratic parties
Anglo-American military alliance
Study at Oxford, scholars, they watchin'
NASDAQ, Dow Jones, got the world stocks in a shamble
Procter and Gamble
Toxins demand you understand who plans to jam you
Some random thoughts by the candlelight in Paris
As I struggle to be savvy Something is fishy, something is bothering me
I just can't figure it out
Something right under my tongue, I can't speak it
Can't spell it, yo it's bugging me out
Somebody doin' something wrong to somebody I know
Somehow it's related to me and now I'm frustrated
Cause now I'm focusing too hard
On something that's just too plain to seeNow $hort! I know you didn't think that shit was over
You little ugly ass nigga! Too $hort...

Now get in where you fit in, chunk

Cause you ain't shit but a punk
So I ain't givin' no rule
To assume you want some mothafuckin' funk

Ain't no love, $hort Beep, beep, beep
Oh, there goes my pager
And it's your bitch, yo, I think I best to fade her
Took her to the motel parking lot
Little light skinned bitch got just a little too hot
It's goin' down, pannies comin' off
Another tramp bitch got automatically toasted
I think you found out and got jealous
Cause I was diggin' your bitch
And runnin' back tellin' all the fellas
But you took her home
And wanted to marry the bitch
I would dig her in this, mister
And bury the bitch
Stop spendin' all your cash and fix your teeth

The ones you least expect you know them square ass niggas in your city
They be the ones who have a grip , they be the ones who be sittin pretty
Instead of tryin to be super to start a fuckin track man
What a nigga really need to do is sit back and straight stack man
Cuz I've been on this Earth for 3 and some odd months man
Trippin off how these niggas out here be straight transforming
Laughing and smiling, loving and hugging a brother grinning
Turn around and talk behind your back the next minute
Bitch we call him bootsee 
Let me define it you can rewind it after I finish spittin
But what about bootsee
It be them bootsee muthafuckas in your town that's always dieying
It be them bootsee muthafuckas in your town that's always dieying
Bootsee is that busta with in no gizame
With in no gizame, with in no gizame You's a loud talkin runnin off the mouth deeck
Wishy washy be puttin yourself on front street
Sloppy grindin, failizing, bitch buying pussy licka
That's what hella heads be sayin about that bootsee nigga
And ah
In case some of y'all ain't knowin this
Do to do almost anything to be noticed
Like ah
Pull out his whole bank account And dang near everything he owns
And ah
Tell everybody in the hood that he got a chip in his phone
And how the fuck you gone be about you scratch when you gossip like a
Batch
And all them fools know where your stash be at
That ain't no sharp shit
Nigga that's that ho shit
Potna just keep on doin what you do and watch your perv get peeled
Ridin around here loose stickin out dumb like a soar thumb
Nigga tell the truth
Don't have a gun but I need one
You want to come up quick in this old shit so you can get it
But how the fuck you gone make your revees givin out credit
To tweakers, droamers, drifters, leftovers, geekers, zombies
Folks that steal from they mommies
When I was doin my thang I had strategy main
Sellin' that white girl you should have seen me main
You would have been proud of yo nigga cuz I was briliant wid it
I snuck in and snuck out without slippin in it
Get what you need out the game and sit your ass down
Invest your money In some thangs and start clockin' pal 
Lost in a dark place
Lost in a dark place
Lost in a dark place Lost in a dark place
Trapped in the crawl space
In my mind I get lost in
I wake up in a coffin
They tell me they care
They're just in love with the music
So they'll never know
About the pain I go through
It's like a chain of reactions
All these demon attacks
From all the drugs that I'm taking
To the women distracting me
From being myself
It's like I'm losing my traction
Kiss death on the lips
I have a fatal attraction This is my heart
Watch as my problems inspire me
Tear me apart
Won't let the demons take over me
They took it too far
Now I need some surgery
I'm falling apart It's like I'm lost in the motions
Use this song as a rope
To wrap around the commotion
Tie the knot at my throat
I look at death as a notion
I don't want it no more
But it's too late to reverse it
As I fall on the floor Lost in a dark place
Lost in a dark place
Demons inspire me
Floor
Yeah...
Come experience... life as we know it
As some of you should know it
Place: Marcy, Brooklyn
Actions: well, y'all know the actions Uhh, I got this shorty on my block always clocking my rocks
He likes the style and profile I think he want to mock
He likes the way I walk, he see my money talking
To honies hawking I'm the hottest nigga in New York and
I see his hunger pains, I know his blood boils
He want to run with me, I know this kid will be loyal
I watched him make a few ends, to cop his little sneakers and gear
Then it's just enough for re-up again
I see myself in his eyes, I moved from Levi's
To Guess to Versace, now it's diamonds like Liberace
That's just the natural cycle, nobody want to be like Michael
Where I'm from, just them niggas who bounced from a gun
We out here trying to make hard white into cohhhhld green
I can help shorty blow out like Afro-Sheen
Plus I can relive my days of youth which is gone
That little nigga's peeps, it's time to put him on It's time to come up 
Gots to lock it down and when they rush 
It's time to come up 
Gots to lock it down and when they rush  I'm out here slinging, bringing the drama, trying to come up
In the game and add a couple of dollar signs to my name
I'm out here serving, disturbing the peace
Life could be better like my man reclined in plush leather seats
He's selling weight, I'm selling eight.. balls
Sixteen, trying to graduate to pushing quarters y'all
I ain't going to sweat him I'm a let him come to me
If he give me the nod then these niggas going to see
I'm tired of being out here round the clock, and breaking day
And chasing crack heads up the block for my pay
I'm staying fresh, so chickens check
I'm trying to step up to the next level
Pushing Vettes through the 'jects, diamonds reflect from the sun
Directly in your equilibrium, and stunned
I'm waiting for my day to come, I got the urge to splurge
I don't want a lifetime sentence, just give me the word It's time to come up 
Gots to lock it down and when they rush 
It's time to come up 
Gots to lock it down and when they rush  Hey fella I been watching you clocking
Who me? Holding down this block it ain't nothing
You the man nigga, now stop fronting
Hahah I like your style 
Let's drive around awhile 
Here's a thou' 
I want the long-term riches and bitches
Have it all, now listen to me
You let them other niggas get the name, skip the fame
Ten thou' or a hundred G keep your shit the same
 Yeah, the only way to blow
You let your shit bubble quietly 
Hey keep your cool
The only way to peep a fool is let him show his hand
Then you play your cards, then he through dealing I understand
Don't blow your dough on hotties
The only thing I got in this world is my word and my nuts
And won't break them for nobody
Hah, I like your resume, pick a day, you can start
From now until death do us part, nigga It's time to come up 
Gots to lock it down and when they rush 
It's time to come up 
Gots to lock it down and when they rush 
It's time to come up 
Gots to lock it down and when they rush 
It's time to come up 
Gots to lock it down and when they rush 
You know my.. my whole def-a-nation is to spit straight game

Pimped-out all day you know Hillside Vallejo nigga
You undersmell me? Been speakin the real for many moons
My niggas in the 7-0-7 on down to Compton I'm in my FUBU drawers, she in her gown
Cause if some cats tryin to have at me
I sick the canine in the background
I'm plannin on splittin my crown but it ain't gon' be too simple
See I'm a baller, I got bars around the window
Rottweilers, pits, aikietas, doberman pischers tanked up in the yard
With a sign on the fence that reads warning: beware of dog!
You play the frog if you feel froggish nigga leap
I neglect my dogs, starvin, sometimes they don't eat
Elroy speak to me about my triple-beam; officer, I got proof
Po'-po', that's for weighin nuts and fruits
Run with a whole bunch of rugged rowdy-ass knuckleheads, knahwhatImean?
Big nigga, the size of a football team
I wear these glasses so that I can look like a square
But if you ever see me in a fight with a bear
Don't help me nigga, help the bear!!
Me and my wales, we be coonin
But see you the type of the nigga that'll go in the backroom
And beep yo'self and act like yo' pager boomin Yeah man, cause a real tycoon
Gon' take this shit from the flo' to the moon
Still Northstar ridin, six-oh strikin
Switch up V-S cherry chokin the wrist and the pinkie
But keep it loose around the neck and make sure hoes in check
So if you gon' fill a nigga cup, fill it up with paper
Cause we ballaholics bitch, ain't that quiet about this shit
If you're on it spend it like you mean it Uhh, I'll have you
Ever since I was ankle low to a centipede's claw
I always wanted to play pro-baseball
Weepolization family, that's my favorite sport
But instead I'm back and forth to jail and in and out of court
BEOTCH! Serious about my rock shrine
I don't give a fuck how much courage juice you had
Nigga yo' mug don't mean like mine!
I bring the noise like a cymbal {*CRASH*}
I fuck with 40 dem, make you stick your pistol out the window
BEOTCH! Y'all oughta see me at the state fair
Showin off in front of my broad; tryin to win my lil' nieces
One of the biggest stuffed animal prizes there
Nicknamed Charlie but my street name is Earl
Ballaholic like Felix Mitchell nephew Lil' Darrell
I know these streets like the Task Force know dope
I am the streeets, my ghetto pass can't be revoked
Ten percent, I paid my tithes, forgive me for my sins
Smoke an ounce of weed a day, maybe that's why I ain't go no ends You see, you niggas real truant mayne
Runnin around here puttin a black eye in the game
When we tryin to feed y'all somethin nutritional for the brain
And nourish yo' game
You see there's two type of niggas in this world:
Those that eat and those that don't
What type of nigga is you, you know?
You see we got the tycoon status
Big hogs, tryin to pile the money up out your trash
You dig? You can call me Lawry's cause I'm seasoned
I eat crevice, but not when it's bleeding
Don't get me wrong, I love sex but I don't play that part
I love Virginia, but not when the Virginia's tart
Toss me good, and I might Dolce and Gabbana it
Gave yo' ass some bread, and let you go buy up some shit
Callin yourself takin advantage of my riches
I'm tryin to be nice to yo' ass
I normally talk bad about you bitches
Invested to Tha Hall of Game buggin and bein notorious
For slappin chickenheads upside they weave-a with my Nokia
Mayday mayday, callin all patrol cars and units
Be on the lookout for the Hillside managler, 40-Water the Ballaholic
I'D RATHER FLY THAN RIDE AMTRAK
When I'm in Dallas I fuck with , and go hard black
Make an opera singer wanna write some raps
Papered up - like who? Like a fax BEOTCH I know you didn't say papered up like a fats
 Yeah, cause we do this shit
Up off the ground on a pitcher's mound
Slidin, to the bad catcher, able to snatch ya
Bat yo' G out the pocket

Same way she come

All women scum 
Get the fuck away from me 
I was blinded by love 
But now I can see 
You ain’t never made me happy 
You just made me believe Realest shit I ever spoke, spoke, spoke
Realest shit I never wrote, wrote, wrote
Mixed the perky with the Four Loko whoa
You're not supposed to mixed the liquor with the narcos
Damn that’s to numb the pain from these
Scandalous bitches in my brain I mean
All girls seem to be the same I mean
Your girl still gon' give me brain I mean
Let the wind blow her out my life
Anything romantic turns to suicide, suicide
Let the wind blow her out my life
Anything romantic turn to suicide, suicide Same way she come 
Same way she leave 
All women scum
Get the fuck away from me 
I was blinded by love 
But now I can see 
You ain’t never made me happy 
You just made me believe You make me believe
Love ain’t meant for me
This is crazy, this insanity
Thought you was my lady, now you hate me
Still got the blueprints yeah, no Jay-Z
I wear Gucci, Louis, Fendi kicks just to hide the pain
Balenciaga on my sweater and umbrella for the rain
I always told myself I would never fall in love again
The next day I find a new queen to fall in love again
Don’t got nothin' to gain
I’m sittin' in the rain
She just ruined my life, and she stole my cocaine
I don’t even do no cocaine
I don't want that shit no way
I go that shit for her to increase the foreplay
Yeah Same way she come 
Same way she leave 
All women scum
Get the fuck away from me 
I was blinded by love 
But now I can see 
You ain’t never made me happy 
You just made me believe
'Cause you can't knock the hustle...
Ohh, uuuuuuahyeah, uuuuuuooooooh
Foooooool's, paradise
Jay-Z, ha ha, Meli'sa Morgan
You better think twice
Roc-A-Fella y'all, it don't stop
'Cause it's not very nice We about to change this game dear
Check my pockets, ain't nothing but game there
I remain without peer, keep the lames clear
And the cats that's all about scratch remain here
On top of this Metropolis
My name's like a swear
Dropped off every tier
Now y'all can swear to Jay
Heard it the other day
Through the missive, peep how they script it
We got to hit you every night 'fore we hit the lights, it's type addictive
Need cash to live with, the beat goes on
Every day is a hustle, the heat grows on
Funny thing happens when years of chasing money unfolds
And the only thing worse than getting old is not getting old
Niggas stay low, like six-fours of shit and gold
And watch for hoes with form fitting clothes
And I, hope you shine
Seen many wrinkles and enough memories to last you two lifetimes
Can't knock the hustle I'm taking out this time 
To give you a piece of my mind
'Cause you can't knock the hustle, how we do
Who do you think you are?
Maybe one day you'll be a star Check this
In a man's world need a girl to touch something
Pull an 80 out her Anne Klein purse and bust something
If you skating through the night to the light, then trust something
When I get home, then it's on
Girl just crack your shaped legs like Grade A eggs
Love the way you behave and beg
Moans, turns to hollers and screams as we zone like a college team
Then they can hear you from Hollis, Queens
Life with me, consists of a lot of things
Chicks in your ear, kicking dirt, 'cause you got hotter rings
But you know how to scream, friends talking dizziness
Remind them freak chicks, stay out my bizziness
Know they can't love it, trips to L.A. with no luggage
Came back with six bags struggling
In first class if my ass should crash, champagne spilled on me
Steak still warm on me You can't knock the hustle
But until then baby, I'm the one who's crazy 
'Cause that's the way you're making me feel 
The way you're making me feel 
I don't want no romance, I just want the chance
Can't knock the hustle for real  Ever since I retired, working alongside of live wires
To this rap biz with fake nigs you know liars
I guess I'm biased 'cause what I talk about I live
These rap dudes conflicted
Some of them ain't even rapping for chips
What part of the game is this?
Seems brainless, on tours like whores, guess what I'm saying I miss
Cats that go all out for their gold plaques
Started with four jacks, ended up with gold Ac's
Bet your lungs collapse if my funds get trapped
On their, way to me through you, screw you
Gun blew you, out of one then two shoes
Run through you like um, excuse you
But that's my cash, gotta understand your hustle
But that's my cash, you don't understand
Let my dough pass, you can show it love
Like a rap star in front of the club
But don't knock the hustle I'm taking out this time
To give you a piece of my mind
Who do you think you are?
Baby one day you'll be a star
But until then baby, I'm the one who's crazy
'Cause that's the way you making me feel
The way you making me feel
'Cause you can't knock the hustle
I don't want no romance, I just want the chance
Can't knock the hustle for real
'Cause you can't knock the hustle
90 racks for the watch, 30 stacks for the chain
A 50 bar for the medallion, diamonds drippy like the rain
Lower development housing is where I was taught to talk my talk
In the thick of the smudge, the slime, on the tar like crosswalk
A young factor having scrilly, spending blue notes in a drought
Living for the moment, fuck further out
Tomahawk by my kidney, MCM belt
Fucker want beef, I'm make him a patty melt
I'ma see you about something, send my crash dummy
He ain't from Japan, but he like to play kamikaze
Your bitch got sloppy toppy, off of the ginger ale with Jack
She got that hot throat with a built-in thermostat
I'm smoking agricultural and vegetation in the backseat zone and blazin'
In the clean 19 with the dealership plates, insurance and registration
Garnished and decorated with all the toppings and all the fixings
We don't fuck with turf dirt, we only fuck with vixens I don't jog, fuck the brown police dog
From the Yay, apartment complexes and smog
Get it, count money in the fog
What? Ballhog
I don't jog, fuck the brown police dog
From the Yay, apartment complexes and smog
Get it, count money in the fog
What? Ballhog, ballhog Hallelujuah! The Lord blessed me with gouda
You can find me on vacation in Barbados or Aruba
Puerto Villarta, Mexico, Bora Bora or Bermuda
Me don't do no snorkel, me don't do no scuba
Under difficult circumstances, I'm having my finances
Used to be the lowest man on the totem pole, used to be the brokest kid on campus
Way ahead of my time, the laughing stock in pre-school
Holes in my pants when ripped jeans wasn't cool
Beat the odds, count my blessings, it's a blessing
Praise God for replying to my message
Suckers don't understand me 'cause they ain't got no understanding
I'm out here feasting, I ain't famine, eating jasmine rice and salmon
Your little gutter chick ain't handling, got you sprung
Need to tell that hoe to douche and brush her tongue
Wandering eyes, wondering why I ain't calling
Come and get your bitch, she out here thottin', reckless eyeballin'...BIATCH! I don't jog, fuck the brown police dog
From the Yay, apartment complexes and smog
Get it, count money in the fog
What? Ballhog
I don't jog, fuck the brown police dog
From the Yay, apartment complexes and smog
Get it, count money in the fog
What? Ballhog, ballhog
Ballhog, ballhog Diamonds are forever
They won't leave in the night
I've no fear that they might
Desert me Diamonds are forever 
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever 
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme
Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?
Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Close your eyes and imagine, feel the magic
Vegas on acid, seen through Yves St. Laurent glasses
And I've realized that I've arrived
'Cause it take more than a magazine to kill my Vibe
Does he write his own rhymes? Well, sort of, I think 'em
That mean I forgot better shit than you ever thought of
Damn, is he really that caught up?
I ask, if you talkin' about classics, do my name get brought up?
I remember I couldn't afford a Ford Escort
Or even a four-track recorder
So it's only right that I let the top drop on a drop-top Porsche
Spoil yourself, that's important
If your stripper name Porsche and you get tips from many men
Then your fat friend, her nickname is Minivan
Excuse me, that's just the Henny, man
I smoke, I drink, I'm supposed to stop, I can't, because— Diamonds are forever 
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever 
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme
Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?
Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? I was sick about awards, couldn't nobody cure me
Only playa that got robbed but kept all his jewelry
Alicia Keys tried to talk some sense in him
Thirty minutes later sein' there's no convincin' him
What more could you ask for? The international asshole
Who complain about what he is owed?
And throw a tantrum like he is three years old
You gotta love it though: somebody still speaks from his soul
And wouldn't change by the change or the game or the fame
When he came in the game, he made his own lane
Now all I need is y'all to pronounce my name
It's Kanye, but some of my plaques, they still say Kayne
Got family in the D, Kin-folk from Motown
Back in the Chi, them Folks ain't from Moe Town
Life movin' too fast, I need to slow down
Girl ain't give me no ass, you need to go down
My father been said I need Jesus
So he took me to church and let the water wash over my caesar
The preacher said we need leaders
Right then my body got still like a paraplegic
You know who you call; you got a message, then leave it
The Roc stand tall and you would never believe it
Take your diamonds and throw 'em up like you bulimic
Yeah, the beat cold, but the flow is anemic
After debris settles and the dust get swept off
Big K pick up where young Hov left off
Right when magazines wrote Kanye West off
I dropped my new shit, it sound like the best of
A&R's lookin' like, Pssh, we messed up.
Grammy night, damn right, we got dressed up
Bottle after bottle 'til we got messed up
In the studio, with Really Doe, yeah, he next up
People askin' me if I'm gon' give my chain back
That'll be the same day I give the game back
You know the next question, dog: Yo, where Dame at?
This track the Indian dance to bring our reign back
What's up with you and Jay, man? Are y'all okay, man?
They pray for the death of our dynasty like Amen
R-r-r-r-right here stands a man
With the power to make a diamond with his bare hands Diamonds are forever 
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever 
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme
Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?
Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Diamonds are forever 
Diamonds are forever 
Can I kick it? 
Can I kick it? 
Can I kick it? 

Can I kick it? 
Can I kick it? 
Can I kick it? 
WELL I'M GONE! Roc-A-Fella forever, Hov' for life
Debut's a classic, first album, four mics
Should've got a five, but niggas lack foresight
But I don't give a fuck, I ain't do it for the hype
I do it for the hustlers for the ghetto for the plight
For the struggle for those who bubble white
For fly 4X4s, roofless cars, flawless ice
For the pain for y'all to know what it's like
For every time it rains 40 days and 40 nights
For every promise made that never saw the light
I'll get my own forty acres, give me four nights
Four O's, a Glock 40 for the jackers and I'm right
Or the four-four will suffice
A fourteen-year-old to look out for the vice
You can sit back and just wait for the flight
Your boy'll take off like I've been strippin' all my life
That's the type of metaphors I write
To let niggas know I was real before the mic
Four front rows, had the fur at the fight
No PETA on my Peter, left some room for the divas
In the suite, we'll meet up if ya wild for the night
On the rampage, champagne pours, on the floor
For all those who ain't make it here and lost they life
Wouldn't forget y'all for any price
Not for no hoes, not for no ice
Not for no fame nor for bright lights
So I'ma end this here real mean, but I'm right
44 fours, muh'fucka, I'm NICEHit ya ass on the celly, 'cause I ain't got time
To be arguing with your ass, if you ain't really ready
Girl, why you never ready? For as long as you took
You better look like Halle Berry... Or Beyoncé
Shit, then we getting married
I brought sand to the beach 'cause my beach is better
You can keep ya beach 'cause that beach whatever
Started out at The Darby, ended up at 1 Oak
Left the house with 100 grand, ended up near broke
Don't get mad at me, I'm buying bucket after bucket
When it's gone I'm like Fuck it
I replace it with another one
Can't take this money with you
Burn this shit up like I'm Richard
Niggas asking Is the oven on? This is a public service announcement
We call it Blood Sport
I had to do one too, I sorry! I'm a competitor
Oh my god it about to get hideous
I hope ya niggas know you history Homie go ask Doc 
Homie go ask Nas 
Homie go ask Jay 
But when you ask them all 
I'm the best in LA. In LA
Or wherever the fuck that you stay It's all copastetic. Hip-hop no longer face Armageddon
Call me Bruce Willis
No call me lieutenant tinted windows on the black benz
So they only see it late nights like Jay Leno
I fuck twice your girlfriend probly told you we can't fuck
No she lying
Oh my god I am the best rapper under 25 you can underline it
You abusing the game you defiant
Disobedient student need attention
Have parent conference I'll be there, Just let me know what classroom you in my son
I am Dwyane Wade of recording
You more like Kobe Bryant with no endorsements
That's like Shaq at the freethrow, pointless
I'm equivalent to a Earl Boykins, Spud Webb, Muggsy Bogues
I suppose I handle the rock well
I do hoes like Stockton and Malone: make my pick then roll
The ugly ones go to Sam Cassell
You washed up like Nick Van Exel.
Shawn Kemp, Robert Parish, John Salley whole career on the bench
Let's get deeper in these NBA statistics
My team something like the retro Celtics
Which means consecutive championships
Which means I'm Larry Bird's equivalent
To the way I do a verse he handle the ball
The same way I handle it with no pen
I call Jay Rock when I wanna dish it off
He bang like Vince Carter when he first saw NBA Court
Alley oop the court let him do what he want
Bang. Aw fuck it let's talk more sports
How bout football?
I run the game like Walter Payton back 1984
I'm pass you niggas like Peyton Manning
Play the field like Ray Buchanan
When I kick it like Morton Anderson it gets scary
Weight on my shoulder, refrigerator Perry
Hip-hop cops on me I dodge them like Barry
Sanders... John Madden hold your commentary
Keep the cameras on I'm primetime like the '95 Deion
Should I keep going?
Aw fuck it let me keep going
I'mma do it like the '97 T Owens
Not the ‘07 T Owens
T Owens with Jeff Garcia throwing the pigskin
Y'all need to work on y'all defense, I train like Warren Sapp on the weekend
Maneuver like Warrick Dunn
I'm just having a little fun have some with me
Let's go baseball now the '94 Ken Griffey
One man roster matter fact I'm the '96 Mike Piazza
MVP of LA, call the doctor
I came up with my assumptions I must be rap ESPN or something
It’s about time for halftime reporting
I’m a star kicking niggas off the field and court man
I know you good with the right but you still ain’t nice till you do it with the left hand
You ain’t nice till you play all positions
Or knock it out the stadium, hey wait a min
I got tickets to the all star game, to pro bowl game baby girl bring a friend
I’m a get you in, I’m a take you out, I’m a stick it in
You might say… ouch
Just let me score one time
Dribble my balls to the floor one time
I’d be going for a week bet they gon’ miss me more than a pitch from Nolan Ryan

Not again Yeah, I learned the game from William Wesley, you can never check me
Back to back for the niggas that didn't get the message
Back to back, like I'm on the cover of Lethal Weapon
Back to back, like I'm Jordan '96, '97
Whoa—very important and very pretentious
When I look back, I might be mad that I gave this attention
Yeah, but it's weighin' heavy on my conscience
Yeah, and fuck, you left The Boy no options
I wanna see my niggas go insane
You gon' make me step out of my fuckin' frame
You gon' make me buy bottles for Charlamagne
You gon' make me go out of my fuckin' way
I waited four days, nigga, where y'all at?
I drove here in the Wraith playin' AR-AB
I'm not sure what it was that really made y'all mad
But I guess this is what I gotta do to make y'all rap
I mean woah, can't fool the city, man, they know what's up
Second floor at Tootsies, gettin' shoulder rubs
This for y'all that think that I don't write enough
They just mad ‘cause I got the Midas touch
You love her, then you gotta give the world to her
Is that a world tour or your girl's tour?
I know that you gotta be a thug for her
This ain't what she meant when she told you to open up more
Yeah, trigger fingers turn to Twitter fingers
Yeah, you gettin' bodied by a singin' nigga
I'm not the type of nigga that'll type to niggas
And shout-out to all my boss bitches wifin' niggas
Make sure you hit him with the prenup
Then tell that man to ease up

You still ain't did shit about the other one
I got the drink in me going back to back
Yeah, going back to back

Not even when you saying, Drizzy, tell 'em again!
I been puttin' on a show, it was a sell-out event
Oh, you need better seatin'
I didn't wanna do it, gave me every reason
The point I'm tryin' to make is I don't ever need 'em
Seen what you’d do for fame, what would you do for freedom?
Please, check 'em for a wire or a earpiece
Please, please do not let these niggas near me
Please, think before you come for the great one
Please, who's a real nigga and who ain't one?
Please, somebody stop me
I'm talkin' boasy and gwanin wassy
I got the fest in five days and it's my shit
Soon as a nigga hit the stage, they gon'...
They gon' ask if I can play this shit back to back
Yeah, they want it back to back
They gon' ask if I can play this shit back to back
I took a break from Views, now it's back to that, nigga  
Yeah this Pimps Christmas
Yeah this Pimps Christmas

Snoopy DO-Double G aw nigga please
Let me show you how it is what we lookin' for
We tryna get the dough I'm at the liqour store
I'm tryna crack a hoe, you know I'm gettin' dough
I'm in a Bentley you know that motherfucker snow
It's all white delight, you know its extra tight
I'm tryna crack a bitch til I get my money right
You know I'm extra tight, I'm takin' hella flight
Catch a bad bitch I'm just like Dolomite
It's a pimp Christmas, that's what it is nigga
 I should be more mature, sure, I'm spoiled
Hit up the south of France after tour, bonjour 
How many girls pre-bate right before they date
So she can have restraint? She still get slayed 
That's ill behavior, want the whip matted
Want her ass the fattest, beat it: Thriller jacket
A street metaphor: if your dog piss on the floor
Put his nose in it, check these niggas from the door Oooh oooh la la, oui-oui amour
Plenty of kisses, plein de bisous
Good day and best wishes
Comment allez-vous?
Bonjour Eat at selective kitchens, speak on our next intentions
Over-creamy Polenta, it come chef recommended 
Come through the side entrance; I arrived, bitches
Crackheads still owe me from '89 fixes 
Havin' drinks in Vegas, my business
She didn't see me comin', now she's an eyewitness
Laissez le bon temps rouler
Say ahh so the kids could play Oooh oooh la la, oui-oui amour
Plenty of kisses, plein de bisous
Good day and best wishes
Comment allez-vous?
Bonjour Vacation, twisted, whatever happened, missed it
Vacations I didn't like, put myself through a guilt trip 
All these beautiful places, but the cities be poor
You wealthy when your kid's upbringin' better than yours
All this money we gettin' could be gone in a minute
If we don't invest it—we long-term affected
Watch who you gettin' pregnant, that's long-term stressin'
I got a mil for every bump on your face, that's what I call a blessin'
Flexin' My head looks straight up
And I'm wonderin', What did I do? 
She looked at me like, Damn, did I surprise you?
Sure enough, as the sky's blue, she turned back around
And walked back down the avenue 
She's waitin' for the right cue 
I'm waitin' for the right clue 
She be leavin', still I smell of eau de parfum
She can't run 'cause I got Cinderella's right shoe
In that white gown that I be seein' right through
Crowd obscurin' my view
There's nothin' left to argue 
At least there's not from my view 
Before I commit suicide, lives will be taken
Mmm, real hip-hop, west coast Yo, yo
Before I commit suicide
I see to it that a million MCs die, lyrical homicide
Walk up on 'em, circle the block
Hit 'em again less than 5 minutes exact, then fleeing the spot
This is Armageddon, two weapons, two palms
Guns drawn, bang! Motherfucker, bang!
One man Vietnam
.45 popper, rhyme like the 9-5 big poppa
On a seven deck yacht, eat lobster with my comrades
Head doctor, knee pads
Gave it to her out of courtesy
Curtains close on that Maybach
Lay back as I hop on my underground shit
Like a subway, derail the track, the real is black
True rhyme sayers, hitmen, crime payers, llama throwers
Hustle in front of corner stores
Street catered, for been living on minimum wages
It's not a threat, I'm doing myself a favor
With suicide Before I commit suicide
Before I commit suicide
Suicide, it's a suicide
Suicide, it's a suicide
Suicide, it's a suicide
I got my mind on the murder and the murder on my mind You a liar, you and I are not alike
I flow like water, purify mics
Ask Sean Carter, Nasir Jones
Or anyone sitting on the throne
Don't get your career postponed
Women, children, I rode past in traffic
Can't steer, cars crash
I got a death wish, you might be on my guest list
I wrap rappers on stretchers
Guns clap in the direction your sepsis
No matter your gender, not sexist
You MC? You better surrender
I love breakfast, lunch and dinner
Killing these rappers
Sparring in the winter, training in the summer
More practice, let's continue
Doing numbers like an accountant
You wonder like knife, how much money I'm counting
You're damn right, I spit it pretty precise
And whenever the verse is done, means I took me another life Suicide, it's a suicide
Suicide, it's a suicide
Suicide, it's a suicide  I delete MCs under concrete
Verbal mass destruction, you want it? Then call me
A killer, I put these rappers on their death bed
One shot to the heart, one more to the head
My rhymes so clever I never fall off
From an industry nigga, they all get hauled off
But not from a sawed-off, but more like an uzi
Spit rap, and these succulent MCs get chewed, B
Money, power, respect, pussy and pistols
Hoes pop pills like it's a modern day ritual
But I don't sweat 'em y'all, I just behead 'em y'all
And leave the party jumping like players of B-ball
The B-board, those will die who decoy
Destroy any rapper thinking he make noise
It's K-Dot, the terminator
Fake rapper rhyme slayer
Those who live now will die later The suicideHey homeboy, what you know bout them local house parties?
Posted right next to the hennessy
We do the same old dance over here
We like.. Poke ya elbows out and swang like this
Poke ya elbows out and swang like this Hold up homie, you ain't known around here to roll up homie

Till the neighborhood watch ain't concerned no mo'
I let the neighborhood watch when I open the trunk
A car show is what they got and everybody go What you know about that California lifestyle? Im giving you a walkthrough of the block and down the street
Los Angeles scan less, police Cutlass and Caprice

Word to Jay Rock

I'm like a Glock, nigga, I always got a hot sixteen, knamean? I was a young lad of seventeen
My life had yet to show its ugly face
Only a pretty façade, hey God, it's me
Remember three, thousand
The one who used to pray to be a rapper
My child's in the third grade
His favorite rapper wasn't rapping 'til he heard me
I wasn't rapping till I heard something called Eric B
And Rakim's Paid in Full
Rap is really getting paid in full
So full that the kids don't go to school
In hopes of becoming one of us
The only requirement is you bust
Now college is looking slim, product is hooking them
Before their brains fully develop, they get enveloped by the  vision teller
The television tells them their vision
Now it's hard for them to make decisions without feeling
Uncool, unschooled, thumb rule
Rule of thumb, you can't be dumb
I wish I would've studied abroad
Well I studied a broad and she studied me back
And my course was hard
That was that, this is this, listen up
'Cause all I'm saying is
If thirty's the new twenty, thirty's the new twenty for them wheels as well
They looking for that mic or some pills to sell
While the girls are steady graduatin'
Nigga's standin' on the corner hatin', debatin'

Wait 'til I get my money right I had a dream I could buy my way to heaven
When I awoke, I spent that on a necklace
I told God I'd be back in a second
Man it's so hard not to act reckless
To whom much is given, much is tested
Get arrested guess until he get the message
I feel the pressure, under more scrutiny
And what I do? Act more stupidly
Bought more jewelry, more Louis V
My Momma couldn't get through to me
The drama, people suing me
I'm on TV talking like it's just you and me
I'm just saying how I feel man

Old folks talking 'bout, Back in my day
But homie this is my day
Class started 2 hours ago, oh am I late?

And you can live through anything if Magic made it
They say I talk with so much emphasis
Ooh they so sensitive
Don't ever fix your lips like collagen
And say something when you gon' end up apolog'ing

Let that man get past
He don't even stop to get gas
If he can move through the rumors, he can drive off of fumes 'cause
How he move in a room full of no's?
How he stay faithful in a room full of hoes?
Must be the pharaohs, he in tune with his soul
So when he buried in a tomb full of gold
Treasure, what's your pleasure?
Life is a, UH, depending how you dress her
So if the Devil wear Prada, Adam Eve wear nada
I'm in between but way more fresher
With way less effort, 'cause when you try hard

Well if you're gonna throw shade my way

Talkin' bout me, but you lookin' bad, woah
Like the ugly daughter that I never had, woah
And what's up with these niggas?
Got my name in they mouth like they swallowin' my children
I never got why niggas hate
It's probably cause I'm doin' better than them anyway
It's probably cause I get they bitches wetter anyway
It's probably cause I'm livin' and they're in a lower place
They walkin' in the slums while I'm vibin' out in space
Crash land just to take they girl on a dinner date
When haters see me winnin' they just hyperventilate
They always try to stop me but I never hesitate
Just follow all your dreams and when you reach them, celebrate
That's the only way to truly make a hater suffocate All these fuck niggas on my line
Damn nigga you must wanna die tonight

Picture us married, you and me, what?
K-I-S-S-I-N-G
I remember the first time, girl you and me . . . This ain't no sucka-for-love shit
This ain't no Huxtable-kisses-and-hug shit
First night we fuck, shit, and don't call the next day
This a thug's wedding day, in love
Will we make it? Let us pray
In the limo my niggas, my father, my brothers
Everybody in tuxes gettin' blunted
Hard bottles, mob costumes this ain't no act though
Factual, the pimp shall scoop no more
Yes I'm absolutely sure
I know that she love me, I know that she faithful
We spoke on a prenumptial agreement
Cuz Will and Jada ain't need it
Spoke on eloping, but then I deaded the thought
Cuz she deserves cinderella's ball and the whole shit
But know this
You fuckin' wit' a slit your throat quick
Vehicular explosion, cigar smokin', dark minded, chart climbin
Well spokin say farewell to broke men or rich ones
Throw them phone numbers away cuz this is it hun
Headed to the chapel, my niggas laughin, and its baffling
Cuz just a year ago, it's weird though, I knew I'd get married
To who I knew not
Thought of snatchin Halle up from the dredlock
Pumpin Sade, my head nod
Finally I met the perfect bitch, pardon my French
Rephrase that, someone who make my heart stop
Couldn't wait to blaze that
Tired of hoppin' from honey to honey, HIV spreadin'
Everybody bump the same bunnies
The game, will put niggas in they grave
Right before they part ways, with the street
I want a son to greet, every mornin'
Daughters and more sons tickle my feet
Wife smilin, tellin me it's time to eat
I'm getting married  
Say hello to the man, goodbye to the gigalo
It was difficult for me to find the chick I want It was my dream for my queen to put the ring on and ride
Even Martin Luther King had a fling on the side
That's what the negative one's say
Knew my wedding would be one day, but quickly its this day
I know the hoes gonna miss me
Lookin' at ol' photos, sayin' damn he used to twist me
Start chokin' up since I woke up
Bachelor party was crazy, tryin' hard just to sober up
Father saw me in a daze, nudged me wit' his left arm
Told me how him and moms went to city hall, dressed norm
Said she would love me in my Ozwald Boateng
Customized in London by guys who suitup kings
Girl, you get the rings young, you behave
Maxwell he gon' sing, invited Lauryn Hill and the gang
Baltimore, North Cacky, Mississippi
Family packed in, My nigga L is crazy tipsy
Spilled Pepsi on the cuflings, ginger ale got it out
Walked in the church, chest all big to thug it out
My girl walked in, glistenin', different stones
'Bout to go from my fiance' to Mrs. Jones
That's a union that nobody could touch
I gotta be cool, wit ur crazy aunts and uncles
Cuz I love you much, cuz you put up wit' my shit
Court cases, baby mamas
I make a honest woman outta you yet
Everybody starin' at you, I'm at the alter standin
Heart poundin out my chest like a canon
I'm happy, One of my groomsmen, under the music, says don't do it
But they just jokes, some crew shit, they playin', I'm gleeful
I'm stayin I'm sayin vowels all true
Will you take music as your wedded wife? I DO
Sike, this ain't about music, y'all know who I'm talkin to
I'm getting married I'm getting married Yo this Nas niggas whuttup?
QB Album coming, niggas ill Will, Bravehearts
My nigga DJ Clue - put this shit on these niggas
Desert Storm baby 2000! A Drug dealers dream - flip his last Ki, get out the game
Cause entertainment money now is off the chain
I put blunts in niggas caskets, lost in the game
I learned about pain, bodies burnt in drug game
But I'm never gon' die, I never heard of death
Energy could never be destroyed, only the flesh
So when you niggas try to murder me with bullets to my head
This is why you can't kill me niggas I'm already dead, BRING IT!
I'm busting, bodies fall in the cemetery
Black blood raining on the street
All you niggas, buried y'all!
Niggas just came home, fresh out the state greens
Five time felon, thinking he jelling in Queens
It's pitiful - what a bid could do, especially federal
Y'all young thugs wilding, see prison
Got a bed for you waiting, I clapped that Satan
But thought I was dreaming
I woke up masturbating in the bed with demons
I cried with every bit of strength of my small body
This is the life I chose, under God I'm tiny
Hard to find me, I popped up, lock shot-up
You can't B.I., see I'm eternal, not luck
You get shot-up, boxed-up next for the grave
Your flow is one dimensional, your level is 2nd grade
You on top - WHAT?
Copying fuck, I said it first, you repeated
Your false crown covered in dirt - defeated
Y'all niggas all hail, the King is dead
He running like a bitch with his tail between his legs
Still-matic, still eye 4 an eye, wannabe God
You're just the next rapper to die, fucking with Nas
Angel Dust
Yeah, Angel Dust
Yeah
Yeah, Angel Dust Angels with dirty faces, angels with broken wings
The devil's dust, PCP invading bloodstreams
People lining up to get it, fantastic, knew how to flip it
Illegal substance constructed and plus addictive
Trusted and respected, almost got me arrested
All the time I invested in school is now of question
Child prone to violence like a dog returns to its own vomit
A fool for chaos, taking what we could salvage
Hustling is a art, I'm just tryna be smart
Strung out bodies found in the park, Shaolin was my heart
We stood for loyalty, all we had was each other's back
My raps were like crystallized powder before crack
Raw, uncut, like what is sold in front of the storefront
The sidewalk was my brother's office
We cut our losses, I had choices
I took a pen, became the voice for the voiceless
My people walking in a zombie state
Life is short, even mine's at stake The government says that angel dust can kill you if you take it or it can cause you to kill others. The scourge of angel dust has been linked to psychosis, violence, schizophrenia, and the epidemic runs especially rampant in the Bronx. My administration will hunt down these poison pushers and arrest them one my one until we get directly to the source.Intro

 1st Verse:
I gotta girl at home
But she don't cook
I have my condoms in the store cause she won't look
And she neva-eva go to the grocery sto
So I figure it's safe to pull a grocery-ho
She was buyin Alize out the liquor aisle
She said, 'i hope its not too ghetto'
Rock-Dawg, Gold Force, Baggy style
I kept her number on file
For my girl be actin wyld
Like last week, I told her take me to the mall
But she don't drive
My otha girl picked me up at 3:05
She got a brand new car, sixteen
Now the car only 1 yrs old, oh
Man, but the body look grown, whooa!
Before I catch a case I betta take my ass home

I ain't call you
You wanna know why? I mean you know why
How on the low I push jet-skee's so I
Couldn't return them pages, on my motorolla
Nextel, my cell it don't work down there
And what happened in cancun, stay down there
What's happenin here, made me wish I stayed down there

 Last Verse:
Man boo you know what I do
So don't trip when I come home after two
Or three or four
I ain't messin wit them girls no more...this week
The benz coup is so sweet
When I roll down the street
Tears roll down her cheeks
She said, 'you must love that car more than me'
A nigga I was wit chu before the cheese
So you need to work on your priorities
If she went wit 'Fabulous'
I bet that she'd be a:
AR-GU-IN-G, Please
I'm not actin like this cause I'm gettin spins on
WU-KR, Cin-ci-nat-ti
You think I get my voice so deep

For my theme song 
My leather black jeans on 
My by-any-means on
Pardon, I'm getting my scream on 
Enter the kingdom 
But watch who you bring home
They see a black man with a white woman
At the top floor they gone come to kill King Kong
Middle America packed in 
Came to see him and his black kin 
My money was number one draft pick
They still burned his jersey in Akron
If I don't get ran out by Catholics
Here come some conservative Baptists
Saying he overreactin'
Like them black kids in Chiraq bitch Think I'm possessed, it's an omen
I keep it 300, like the Romans
300 bitches, where the Trojans?
Baby we livin' in the moment

I think I'm possessed, it's an omen
I keep it 300, like the Romans
300 bitches, where the Trojans?

I've been a menace for the longest
But I ain't finished, I'm devoted

Early morning cartoon shit
This is that goon shit
Fuck up your whole afternoon shit
I'm aware I'm a wolf
Soon as the moon hit
I'm aware I'm a king
Back out the tomb bitch
Black out the room, bitch
Stop all that coon shit
These niggas ain't doin' it
Them niggas ain't doin' it
What do you say to a masked man
This Inglorious Bastard that’s rapping
We might have to burn this whole suit down
Like the theater that Hitler was trapped in Four in the mornin', and I'm zonin'
I think I'm possessed, it's an omen
300 girls, and we know it

And there's no way to slow down
Runnin' outta time - movin' fast
Just  and enjoy the crash Y'all might as well get the music ready because this finna' take a while
Umm, When I had my accident I found out at that moment nothing in life is promised except death,
If you had the opportunity to play this game of life
you need to arpeeeciate every moment
a lot of people don't appreciate their moment until it's passed And then, you got to tell those Al Bundy stories You remember when I ?
But, Right now is my time and my moment thanks to the fans, thanks to the accident, thanks to god, thanks to Roc-A-Fella, Jay-Z, Dame Dash, G, my mother, Rhymefest everyone that's helped me
And I plan to celebrate, I plan to celebrate and scream and pop champagne every chance I get becasue i'm at the grammys baby! I know everybody's asking the question, they wanted know I know he's going to wild out, I know he's going to do something crazy
Everbody wanted to know what I would do if I didn't win. I guess we'll never know.

My ace Boon just got peelt at the corner store
It's unbelievable I'm shocked this can't be true
Im cryin vengeance for revenge look what I do
Called up my Mossie told my niggas to be on alert
Heard it was some player hating O.G's out there putting in work
From what I understand that shit ain't over no turfs and drugs
It's over some bitches and some jealous niggas with a grudge
Hot at the head I'm fired up I wanna do'em in myself
Hit me up in the corner and watch me let them have it nelf
Money talks and bullshit walks, I'm off to San Leandro
For some Glocks and techno chops and a gang of ammo
Took a hit of the chronic dank to expand my thoughts relax nerves
When I get back to the town just think them niggas gonna get straight served
And a ballerish nigga like me young in the game straight having thangs
Taking this shit from some ol' jealous ass OG's man?
I'm not having it, you want some funk I'll bring it to ya
Dagnamit I thought you suckas already knew ah
Yes indeed, them niggas act like they can't bleed
But them lies, I'm talking about the element of surprise
Bring the noise, whos fallin like the big boys?
Heavens to Merkatroid, I'm ballin like the big boys
I just got the word I heard the same niggas robbed my partner herb
Pulled on his dick with a pair of appliers got him for a bird
It's gettin stanky got my curiosity arousin
See herbs a factor, he's worth $700,000
GTE mobile net cellular comminication

He called me back said Lets go party on them fools E.
I said Where you at?
He said Where you at? I said I'm in Vallejo
He said I tell you what lets hook up me and you at Dennys in the Vill'
I said Roger he said Over and out don't fake out
I said what time he said one o'clock if it's traffic go the back route
Ya see, sloppy jobs ain't my forte so no mistakes
We do it right and when it's done bring the yellow tape 
Bring the yellow tape
Bring the yellow tape
Bring the yellow tape
The yellow tape Wassup my Naga you ready to ride on these ho ass block busters
Thats me an Herb talking outside of Denny's smoking a beedie sittin in my Cutlass
It's only a handful of them suck L's I can count them on my finger
Fuck letting this shit die down I'm ready to hear the fat singers
I'm bout my gats but can't make cash with niggas breathing all down my back
Therefore I must explore by taking a few lives to even the score
My ace Boon, my sugar low, blood pressure high
Drinking and crying two four seven my stomach in and out
I know this one botch that got my nigga that just got out of jail's baby
She'll play hop scratch she works for Pacific Bell and she just might maybe
Help me pull these niggas coat tails true ???
Find out where they sleep by looking up there address on the computer
Herb hollard bingo, tomorrow we ride my naga
Fake ass niggas done stuck there fingers in
Some permanent shit that they can't wipe off 
Yeah, motherfuckers fail to realize the size of this
Oh it's gonna get done, three or four more hot ones
To the fire that already got 'em
Ain't no kind of stress to me
My dick get hard off this type shit boy
Tell that botch to get the 707's on them niggas residential spots
By tomorrow afternoon and it's on Think I didn't? got on it right away
Finally got me a chance to use my Heckler & Knoch collection throw-aways
And when we did I guess you could say we did that
And after that niggas gave me my 'spec Hook
Two A for Angelina, tongue like anaconda

Young, wild, and reckless is how we live life
Pray that we make it to twenty-one 
Oh, we make it to twenty-one 
Oh, ho ho ho, ho ho ho I'm glad we were able to talk about her vice and her evils. There is an even more important topic I'd like to discuss: the dysfunctional bastards of the Ronald Reagan Era. Young men that learned to do everything spiteful. This is your generation. Live fast and die young. Who's willing to explain this story? Ridin' with them boys and girls and we're high

Yo... it's like waking up from a bad dream...
 just to figure out
You wasn't dreaming in the first place If all I saw was gangsters coming up as a youngster
Pussy and money the only language I clung ta
Claim ta, I mold myself up to become one
Ain't ya happy I chose rap? I'm a monster
Streets deceiving, can't believe my achievements
Cultural strata, persona is that of a non-needer
Cause I don't need nada 'cept for Prada beaver
For cold winters, tattoos got my summer sleeveless
To my G's on the flee from the coppers
Stiff bodies on freeze in funeral parlors
From the slums I come up a phoenix caked up
Trying to take what I'm eating came up a dismissive kid
You lucky if you allowed to witness this
Savvy, mild, wild hardly
A man's man, who would've knew the beach houses and wild parties
Jezebels and Stella McCartneys
For years, all that, how can I not be dead?
This old German said I was a thug with a knotty head
Looked at my Benz and called that a Nazi sled
With a face like he wonder where I got my bread
Probably all these stones he see, from my shows overseas
From crime to rhyme, my story is I'm from the home of the thieves America  pay attention
Wake up, this is not what you think it is
America  pay attention
This is not what you think it is Blessed, the Lord is a G, he gotta be
Who's the God of suckers and snitches? The economy
Lipstick from Marilyn Monroe blew a death kiss to Fidel Castro
He'd want me to spit this
Only the strong survive Nas bear witness
The hypocrisy is all I can see
White cop acquitted for murder, black cop, cop a plea
That type of shit make me stop and think
We in chronic need of a second look of the law books
And the whole race dichotomy
Too many rappers athletes and actors
But not enough niggas in NASA
Who give you the latest dances, trends and fashion?
But when it comes to residuals they look past us
Woven into the fabric, they can't stand us
Even in white tees, blue jeans and red bandanas America  pay attention
Wake up, this is not what you think it is
America  pay attention
This is not what you think it is Assassinations, diplomatic relations
Killed indigenous people built a new nation
Involuntary labor, took a knife split a woman naval
Took her premature baby, let her man see you rape her
If I could travel to the 1700's
I'd push a wheelbarrow full of dynamite through your covenant
Love to sit on the Senate and tell the whole government
Y'all don't treat women fair, she read about herself in the bible
Believing she the reason sin is here
You played her, with an apron, like bring me my dinner dear
She the 'nigga' here, ain't we in the free world?
Death penalty in Texas kill young boys and girls
Barbarity, I'm in the double-R casually
Bugging how I made it out the hood dazzle me
How far are we really from third world savagery?
When the empire fall imagine how crazy that'll be America 
America 
This is not what you think it is
America 
This is not what you think it is
America Why everything that's supposed to be bad make me feel so good?
Everything they told me not to is exactly what I would
Man, I tried to stop man, I tried the best I could
But  What's your addiction? Is it money? Is it girls? Is it weed?
I've been afflicted by not one, not two, but all three
She's got the same thing, about me, but more, about us
She's coming over, so I guess, that means, I'm her drugs
Just let me peek now, I mean damn, I'm so curious
She's got a lover, so the lies, and the lust, is a rush
Time's of the essence, I need, you to be spontaneous
Roll up the doja, Henny and Co-Co-Coca-Cola
Then I'm co-coming over cause it's ne-never over Why everything that's supposed to be bad make me feel so good?
Everything they told me not to is exactly what I would
Man, I tried to stop man, I tried the best I could
But  I see the emotion in your eyes, that you, try not to show
We get the closest when you high, or you drunk, or you blown
So I pour the potion, so we could both get high, as we could go
Then I'll get the lotion, and do somethin' to me, when your thighs is exposed
There's no turning back now, I mean I don't mean to impose
Not now but right now, I need you to undress, and then pose
I'm into that now, catch a vibe, when the doors, get closed
Roll up the doja, Henny and Co-Co-Coca Cola
And I keep co-coming over cause it's ne-never over Why everything that's supposed to be bad make me feel so good?
Everything they told me not to is exactly what I would
Man, I tried to stop man, I tried the best I could
But  Why everything that's supposed to be bad make me feel so good?
Everything they told me not to is exactly what I would
Man, I tried to stop man, I tried the best I could
But  I just wanted to ask you
Just wanted to um, let me, how would I put this uhh
Let's say all your friends, remember the one
You said if you ever she would be the one
Ok, ok, ok 
Well I was thinking, hypothetically
I mean don't take this seriously
Don't take me: I mean just, uhh, not credibly
I'm feeling incredibly, I mean let it be
I just let it be
I mean you, her and me 
I mean you, her and me
Maybe, baby, baby
You know I was just kidding
Unless you gon' do it 
Phizzle Phizzle Phizzle

Came in the door like whoa
Pull up
Can't even see no more 
Somebody pull the wool up
Surround myself with loved ones
Later for them haters
And now I'm going up y'all
On a escalator Y'all may think I'm acting brand new
Y'all need to hold up
I'm just tryna give you something new
I'm a different fella
Y'all keep holding me to what I used to do
Stop being judgmental

 Get on up out ya feelings
Come get down with the realest

Y'all know my praise is relentless Coulda sworn that I was having the time of my life
I was turning up

All up in the crowd, Frank Lucas fur coat

Under the influence, I stayed on the first floor, first floor
Wait, first 48, hard to see my face, diamonds in the way
This is MMA, I just beat the case
In and out the hair salon, she got her nails polished
Turn up in tennis shoes, turn up in red bottoms

Lord, forgive me! Lord, forgive me!
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it, but today I'm yelling
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Look inside of my soul and you can find gold and maybe get rich
Look inside of your soul and you can find out it never exist
I can feel the changes
I can feel a new life, I always knew life can be dangerous
I can say that I like a challenge and you tell me it's painless
You don't know what pain is
How can I paint this picture
When the color blind is hangin' with you?
Fell on my face and awoke with a scar
Another mistake livin' deep in my heart
Wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick
I can admit that it did look like yours
Why you resent every making of this?
Tell me your purpose is petty again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge
Even a small lighter can burn a bridge I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me
Then put me on stages, to me that's amazin'
To you that's a quick check

Lord, forgive me! Lord, forgive me!

Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe! I'm tryin' to keep it alive
And not compromise the feeling we love
You're tryin' to keep it deprived
And only co-sign what radio does
And I'm lookin' right past you
We live in a world, we live in a world on two different axles
You live in a world, you livin' behind the mirror
I know what you scared of
The feeling of feeling emotions inferior
This shit is vital, I know you had to
This shit is vital, I know you had to
To die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain
Is way more believable, give me a feasible gain
Rather a seasonal name
I'll let the people know this is somethin' you can blame
On yourselves, you can remain stuck in a box
I'ma break out and then hide every lock
I'ma break out and then hide every lock I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me
Then put me on stages, to me that's amazin'
To you that's a quick check
With all disrespect, let me say this I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
Lord, forgive me! Lord, forgive me!
Things I don't understand

You ain't heard the Coast like this in a long time
Don't you see that long line?

Threes in the air, I can see you are in sync
Hide your feelings, hide your feelings
Now what you better do
I'll take your girlfriend and put that pussy on a pedestal
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
Walk out the door and they scream it's alive

Fully grown with your hormones now
Got your own home and you alone
Wanna bone, wanna moan, get your back blown out

You a big girl now, in a world, where these niggas are foul
You could be aborting the next Michael Jordan
Your man don't wanna be around

She's sexy, she got it, she ride it
Every nigga wanna be inside it, uhh

I need her, I'll eat her
Do anything to please her
My ghetto queen of Sheba I'm the type that'll get you by the fireplace
Get you hype when I lick it, put it by your face
Sipping red wine, is it bedtime
You can kick it with your nigga while we listen to Faith
I'm feeling richer today,I can hit it then stay
Lingerie make me take it to the kitchen and play
We got champagne, whipped cream, I'ma grab a bucket of ice
Bubble bath running, and the candlelight feeling so right
It's your night, no stress, no fight
Mad at your ex, 'cause his dough tight
Never go right when you're with him
Try your best to forget him
'Cause it's easy to please me
CD skip when your head board hit the wall
Call for the lord
Right when you cum, I'm biting your tongue
Make your legs cramp up, you can't stand up
You can hit a blunt if you want
I'ma pull my pants up
We can discuss a weekend of lust on top of the trust
Tell me what's the reason for us
To love or to fuck
I'm the thug that you want
If it's gangster we can't front
If you want me I can stay around
If you need me, I'm here for you
How that sound?
Now it's up to you
Depending on how you wanna get down
'Cause you're a big girl now 
Fully grown with your hormones now
Got your own home and you alone
Wanna bone, wanna moan, get your back blown out

Every nigga wanna be inside it, uhh

I need her, I'll eat her
Do anything to please her
My ghetto queen of Sheba Got your name and your number in my cell phone
Hear your voice and I wonder where you are, if you all alone
If you in a good mood, if you not
Or you thinking bout you was at my spot
What we did when we got hot
Is you dreaming you had me?
Is you creaming your panties?
Like a king, fed me grapes, and you fanned me
On the couch, to the floor, to the bed, to the sink
And we ate each other like candy
Under the covers, two intimate lovers
You fuck a nigga like you mad at me
Throw the ass to me
You should be glad to be
In the presence of a real thug as bad as me
While I'm in the streets with my murdering squad
You talking to your friends that I'm hurting it hard
How I'm making my rod, how I make you say Oh God
Every ho that you know wanna know Nas
Gotta dodge all the blowjobs, getting hard
'Cause you know how these girls are
Wearing tight shit, no panties, no bra
Running up to my car with menage a trois suggestions
Starting to get an erection
Guessing, only if you knew how your crew stressing
Complexion chocolatey, fondle me, thinking it's time to leave
I need time to breathe
Wanna follow me, ironically
You pop up, throwing bottles at my Tahoe
Like it's my fault
But you don't wanna talk
Don't wanna hear nothing, all of a sudden
You and the shorty start scuffing
Now shorty dumping you out
Can't let her get the best of you
So I rescue you
Only thing left to do was to grab her
So you can jab her, get a cheap shot
You don't wanna feel chumped
Now here the cops come
So we gotta run to the ride
Then we drive off through the traffic
Don't panic, but you know how we gotta manage
Looking at your face
And the damage in your facial
Every angle can't let it faze you
No reason to be insecure or immature
Baby girl, see the world is yours 
Fully grown with your hormones now
Got your own home and you alone
Wanna bone, wanna moan, get your back blown out

You a big girl now, in a world, where these niggas are foul
You could be aborting the next Michael Jordan
Your man don't wanna be around

She's sexy, she got it, she ride it
Every nigga wanna be inside it, uhh

I need her, I'll eat her
Do anything to please her
My ghetto queen of Sheba

Fully grown with your hormones now
Got your own home and you alone
Wanna bone, wanna moan, get your back blown out

You a big girl now, in a world, where these niggas are foul
You could be aborting the next Michael Jordan

She's sexy, she got it, she ride it
Every nigga wanna be inside it, uhh

I need her, I'll eat her

My ghetto queen of Sheba
I don't even need a note pad for this one right here man
Shut the lights off
Let the mind work ya know
I like to ummm
I like to take the time to dedicate this to a special somebody
Yes I call her my most recent addition to my collection to female disappointments Deceiving you are the reason that
I don't believe in finding the love that I need and
I'm Uncle Phil I switch wifey like every season
So I guess that makes you aunt Viv
Until you take from me till the point that you can't give
And when I see you out I pass by it's offensive
But what you expect though
Kinda direct yo
Cause all that Dolce and Gabana shit was expensive
I told ya
Mr. Edwards I tried to save your daughter
But she wasn't satisfied with none of the things that I bought her
And wasn't tryna show up none of the places that I brought her
And couldn't utilize none of the things that I taught her
So I was just tryna upgrade you
I ain't ya understudy thats tryna upstage you
I was ya other buddy that tried to front page you
Crown you
Get to know the people that surround you
Funny to think that I woulda white gowned you
Cause Now we sit around the studio and clown you
Oops did I let that slip
Oh my bad did I let that slip
I can't forget that quick Deceiving 
Deceiving  Deceiving you are the reason that
When it gets cold in November seems like it's freezing
And I fit every stereotype that y'all believe in
Cause when I say I'm serious you claim you're only teasin
I planned a trip to the tropics that you missed
So when I'm speakin you only in topic when I'm pissed
And in a couple years I guarantee you'll be thirsty
And by then I'll be lookin like Tropicana twist
What up Tessa I love you like my own mama
And ya daughters getting grown mama
And me I'm just here workin' waitin' patient
For her to be ready for to love and leave her drama
Cause I don't really wanna fight no more
And I don't wanna diss niggas when I write no more
And I don't wanna bring chicks to the crib
To watch a flick in the basement on the bed with dim lights no more
Now I'm losing a feeling
You losing appealing
You need to step it up like prints from shoes on the ceiling
Oh damn did I let that slip oh my fault did I let that slip
I can't forget that quick Deceiving 
Deceiving  My first reaction was damn girl
How did I swing you?
I wanted you forever now I'm something you cling to
But you was my angel, Seems like ya wings grew
Unaware you was outta state doin' ya thing too
Sayin' to my self you deceiving
You are the reason that I don't believe in finding the love that I need
In fact I know you always be lyin' when u be leavin'
Goin' to visit family promise me you ain't cheatin'
A sure thing just might fail you
Women often conduct themselves just like males do
They huddle in a group and joke about the fact that you a soft nigga
How you think cuddling with is cute
They laugh at how you think you last when you really don't
And make u think u get the ass when you really won't
And dudes do that and why these hoes stealin' it
They doin the same shit with a better job at concealin' it
So sign your name on a prenupt and then initial
She only messin with a rapper if it's beneficial
Opps did I let that slip oh my bad did I let that slip
I can't forget that quick Deceiving 
Deceiving  Feel like uh
I feel like we back man 
It's like See, see the problem with these other brothers is that they makin love songs
We makin beyond and above songs you know what I'm sayin
We sayin real stuff we not bitter it's life you know
If ya'll females would pull it together
Maybe we would have something better to talk about Yes,  Weezy baby we Squadron
Tape Pigeons with bricks, some of them with quarters
Send em' cross the border
My bitches originally from across the border
But once mami crossed her border
To my hideaway across the border
She like, cross the floor and we tossed the whore
I'm a floss for sure cause my whip is costing more
Then all of yours put together, I'm good forever
I'm, repping my hood whenever, wherever, however you want it I'll metal ya homie
Hotter than kettles over the stove in the morning
And I'm over the stove in the morning
With a board, coke and some Arm N' Hammer
I, swarm with the hammy and my arm full of ammo
Face-painted like the black sambo
Strapped like Rambo
Can't nobody see the damn flow
I'll have his body see the damn floor
I'm so groovy, I might know how to play a fucking banjo
But I never tried, and when I was twelve I took a bullet like a man yo
But I never died, I'm hear now, I'm that child Tadah
I let the Tech blada, If you stare down
No part, let your hair down
My- ain't got no brain on my sports car
And shawty came out her sports bra
Because I came on her sports bra
I got game like a sports broad-
Caster, Wayne, your bro a master
I'll have my boys masturbate on your broad faster
Bag the hard in the plastic
And watch how I go hard in the Ave wit' it
I move a jag tinted in your residential
Swagger so tight it might pinch you
Ice so white it might irk you
Slide in a  coupe
Rims might hurt you
Interior will murk you Sheesh!
I got work on every outskirt and
I got her out-skirt, out-shirt fam'
I'm the boy, I said I'm the boy man
Mami came aboard in my air on Jordan's
She can't lie cause I glide on Clyde's
And she try to ride with me because I sky on Dominiques's baby
She not hatin' cause I rip on G 
But she love to ride the back of my  on Dayton's
We skatin', you waitin'
She real late and damn you real patient
We real playas but we really don't play
Like Josa Forte, got Doja all day!
Got bread, got toast and Parkay
That's all dough all day
I knocks all hoes all day, I'm mackin vicious
Ask ya girl bout my dick she say That's delicious
Ask your girl did she spit, she say That's nutritious
Ask her did she get flipped she say  That's tradition
If she say she didn't that's suspicious
You need to stop listenin' to them nasty bitches
3, 2,1
Carolina Blue kicks, Carolina Blue fitted
Carolina Blue whip, Carolina Blue twenties
Carolina Blue seats, Carolina Blue ice
Carolina Blue bike, Carolina Blue lights

Aww fuck it my favorite team is the Lakers
Laker Yellow lambo, Laker Yellow 'rari
Laker Yellow nine-eleven, Laker Yellow mami
Laker Yellow Converse, Laker Yellow 
Laker Yellow number 8 Kobe Bryant Authentics
I'm an authentic nigga, and so is my clique
Weezy Baby I just murdered this shit, holla back Okay, uh-huh, okay, uh-huh, okay uh-huh
You already know man, this your boy man
Tell em' my name
Weezy baby, Weezy baby, Weezy baby, Weezy baby
Weezy baby, Weezy baby, Weezy Baby!
It's over, it's really over
Kobe really retired, it's crazy!
It's just a trip to even be doing this right now
Kobe really retiring Call in marks, Kendrick take one What can I say?
I mean really, what can we say?
Day by day, season by season, twenty, to be exact
Growing up watching him paint murals
Using this building as his first studio
Using L.A. as his canvas
Restoring crowns back to where they belong
Under royal banners, purple and gold
The color of royalty
My one man L.A. king Back to Kobe, fallaway pull up
Oh! What a way to finish! Kobe
Never meaningless could never mean less
That's what he means at this moment
All season has been his goodbye
Him to us, us to him, to the whole world Still got magic, but he made it magical
From Compton to Crenshaw
Jack to Jeanie
We were all witnesses
To all things that was him
I mean, we shared with him the world Kobe, inside the three point arc...
Kobe Bryant has hit a shot at the buzzer! WOO! Soon enough, he became our identity
If you wasn't born and raised here
Or never lived here
You probably would never understand
I'm-a make sure you do I'm talking about the 81 points
I'm talking about the afro
I'm talking about the alleyoop to Shaq
The off-glass buzzer beater over D-Wade
The game four overtime takeover in the Finals Kobe
I'm talking about the posterizing of Steve Nash
I'm talking about Dwight Howard's rookie year when he got baptized
You remember that
Kobe bodied him
The helicopter
The five parades
Kobe The mashed-up gamut of emotions with you and with ourselves is so deep
I don't think nobody can break that bond
So I ask, how do empires last when there's no longer an emperor?
I mean, we got you
But at the same time, we got you
I'm talking about your blood, your sweat, your tears
Even your DNA is placed in these L.A. concretes, man
And nothing would ever replace that or erase that
Forever great in our hearts
So with that being said
Know that it's never goodbye
It's simply respect due
Our due, forever
Kobe
Order in court, order in the court
No one else but Mr. Jones has the right to be speaking right now
Order in the court or I’m gonna start making some arresting here
You don’t belong in the court house anyway, your rap concert has been canceled
Order in my court, … I wake up, wake up in the morning shake my third leg in the toilet
Uzi on my night stand, I’m the man you go to war with
Not the man you go to war against,
Patience I get you if that means I can’t sleep a whole year
I get you, I'm official not a tisket, a tasket
I put you in the casket with a biscuit
The ratchet, the smoke a biscuit, the planted trees advanced weed
Doomed forsakers you fucking fake bloods like movie makeup
I flow tight as tootie bracers, who he hating us
I’ll be on the state bus, shackles is my eight bus
Cause y'all some tellers, opposite of bankers
I’m the shit for ages, my clip steel wheel … gangsters
Click still move like free masons, so we’re from on the flow from the law
Cause large is all across the nation, Nas is bread for the plan
The hold the grand dragon head in his hand
Come and get me, here I am
Pok’em, pok’em I’m not a law prayer, so you could tell your mayor
I’m a non-stop driven by poetry slayer
One, two, three, down for the count
The result my lyrics oh yes, no doubt 
Pok’em, pok’em The good man in me gets money and stay on the path
But the Pimp shit in me says yo, keep looking for ass
My daughter gave me a gift, something to hold
A little city in water, when you shake it, it snows
I told her never let a sucker nigga take off her clothes
Better wait till
You’re grown, when in love you will know
Everybody’s gotta dream I hope to wish to own a six times two
… against who I don’t know
So one who fed you won’t blow, you won’t eat, you won’t cake
Pay mistake, blaming me for their failures I'm fresh
Getting tale single breasted
A lip brush is sense less some pimp shit
A women hates a man and stays with him for many years
Tell him she loves him and be jealous of him
Now lame is how the ghetto judge him, cause he’s still with her
She take his cash give it to some other real nigga, like me
Pok’em, pok’em, pok’em  Ah shit, okay, okay, alright
Big man! You wanna make some big bucks, huh?
Let's see how tough you are
You know something about cocaine? Digame!
You kidding me or what man?
There's a bunch of Colombians coming in Friday - new guys
They said they got two keys for us, for openers
Pure cocaine, you tell 'em, capiche?
I want you to go over there
And if it is what they say it is, you buy it, you bring it back
You can do that you make five grand
Meet them at the Bodegas, noon Friday
You get the buy money then
Oh and chico, if anything happens to the buy money
Eh, pobrecito
JAY-Z's gonna stick your heads up your asses faster than a rabbit gets fucked Bounce.. bounce, bounce, Jay-Z huh?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, Roc-A-Fella y'all, ha ha
Bounce, bounce, bounce, Roc-A-Fella y'all
Check, check Yo, I'm making short term goals when the weather folds
Just put away the leathers and put ice on the gold
Chilly with enough bail money to free a big Willie
High stakes, I got more at stake than Philly
Shopping sprees, cop in three
Deuce fever IS's fully loaded, ah, yes
Bouncing in the Lex Luger, tires smoke like Buddha
50 Gs to the crap shooter, niggas can't fade me
Chrome socks beaming
Through my peripheral I see you scheming
Stop dreaming, I leave your body steaming
Niggas is fiending, what's the meaning
I'm leaning on any nigga intervening
With the sound of my money machining 
My cup runneth over with hundreds
I'm one of the best niggas that done it, six digits and running
Y'all niggas don't want it
I got the Godfather flow, the Don Juan DeMarco
Swear to God, don't get it fucked up I'm taking out this time 
To give you a piece of my mind

Who do you think you are?
Baby one day you'll be a star Last seen out of state where I drop my sling
I'm deep in the South kicking up top game
Bouncing on the highway switching fo' lanes
Screaming through the sunroof, money ain't a thang
Your worst fear confirmed
Me and my fam roll tight like The Firm
Getting down for life, that's right, you better learn
Why play with fire, you burn
We get together like a choir, to acquire what we desire
We do dirt like worms, produce G's like sperm
'Til legs spread like germs
I got extensive hoes with expensive clothes
And I sip fine wines and spit vintage flows
What y'all don't know?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, cause you can't knock the hustle But until then lately, I'm the one who's crazy?
'Cause that's the way you're making me feel

The way you make me feel
I'm just trying to get mine, I don't have the time
To knock the hustle for real Yo, y'all niggas lunching, punching the clock
My function is to make much and lay back munching
Sipping Remy on the rocks, my crew something to watch
Nothing to stop, un-stoppable
Scheme on the ice, I gotta hot your crew
I gotta, let you niggas know the time like Movado
My motto, stack rocks like Colorado
Waddle off the champagne, Cristals by the bottle
It's a damn shame what you're not though:  me
Slick like a gato, fucking Jay-Z
My pops knew exactly what he did when he made me
Tried to get a nut and he got a nut and what
Straight bananas; can a nigga see me
Got the US Open, advantage Jigga
Serve like Sampras, play fake rappers like a campus
Le Tigre, son you're too eager
You ain't having it, good me either
Let's get together and make this whole world believe us, huh
At my arraignment screaming
All us blacks got is sports and entertainment, until we even
Thieving, as long as I'm breathing
Can't knock the way a nigga eating, fuck you even! I'm taking out this time
To give you a piece of my mind
Who do you think you are?
Baby one day you'll be a star
But until then lately, I'm the one who's crazy?
'Cause that's the way you're making me feel
I'm just trying to get mine, I don't have the time
To knock the hustle for real None
If I got rich one day, I won the lotto
I'll be up in the club, drunk, poppin' bottles
Imma live it up like it ain't no tomorrow
Big time, big time, big time, big time
But I got to get it my way, I know it ain't pretty
Well, I'll be doing my thang till them boys come and get me
I'll be doing my thang till I run my whole city
Big time, big time, big time, big time [Verse 1:}
I get to it, I hustle, I get it in, trying to win like Steve Wynn
Money long like Jay Leno chin, I didn't put nothing in my government
I paid my bills in money orders when I was in the trap hella heavy
When I used to quarterback that yolla
Perm down to my shoulders trying to get it while it's good
Til the po po's headquarters up a hub station in our hood
A lot of these rappers don't even sound like they believable
But you can ask your daddy and uncle about E feasible
They'll say he the gospel, he a for real fisher
He used to cop from me, now I cop from that nigga
Had to share the same bath water with my brother
Used to argue, fuss and fight over pillows and covers
The low man at the bottom of the totem pole
Used to go the Salvation Army for school clothes
Now I'm a whaler, tycoon bro, everyday is Christmas
Record company, real estate, food and beverage dealers Pimpin' is ugly out here, it's gross
Best friend will try to sneak if you let him get too close
The body will fall if you kill the head
What else?
Lovers turn quick, they forget who buttered their bread
What was you tellin' them?
I was just tellin' one my dudes
They threw the old rules out the window
Created they own new set of rules
When the shit in the air
Be a man, you can't be scared
But you can't be
Try to nip it at the bud before it get too outta hand
Before what?
I got some real ones in the pen
That I visit cause they my folks
Up in there programming
What they making?
Making diamonds outta soap
Just got my car up out the shop
What you got in it?
Retarded knock
Use the loot that I won at a crap game
And painted it butterscotch
You can hear me throbbing up the block from miles away
My neighbours loose it
Po-po's pull me over at least 3 times a day for my music 
My over head 60,000 dollaz a month total
What else?
Conducting business on my sidekick T-mobile Niggas on the money on a first name basis
And I ain't ate all day, I want my birthday cake
So if it ain't about the money, you can get it out my face
If it ain't about money you can walk the other way
Cause I always been about my dough
When they see you doing good, they want to catch you slipping
Cause them boys going to look out you know
That ain't gone ever stop me, now don't you worry about me I am Kanye West, and that feels really great, especially to say this year. I came here to present my new video, but before that, I'ma talk. Now... Later tonight, Famous might lose to Beyoncé, but I can't be mad—I'm always wishing for Beyoncé to win, so, you know! But for people to understand just how blessed we are. It was an expression of our now. Our fame right now. Us on the inside of the TV. You know, just to put... the audacity to put Anna Wintour right next to Donald Trump... I mean, like, I put Ray J in there, bruh! This is fame, bro! Like... I see you, Amber! My wife is a G, not a lot of people's wives would let 'em say that! We came over in the same boat, now we all in the same bed. Well... maybe different boats, but you know. If you think about it, last week, it was 22 people murdered in Chicago. You know, like, people come to me like, Man, that's right! Tell Taylor to... Bro, like, I love all y'all! That's why I called her! So, I was speaking at the Art Institute last year and one kid came up to me and said, Three of my friends died and I don't know if I'm gonna be the next. And it has to... you know, you have to think like, you know when you're a senior and it's like the last month and you just don't feel like doing anymore work? If you feel like you're seeing people dying right next to you, you might feel like what's the point? You know, like, life could be, like, start to feel worthless in a way. I know times for me, I sit down and talk to older, rich people, you know -- aka white -- and uh, they tell me, Don't compare yourself to Steve Jobs, don't compare yourself to Walt Disney. And my friend Sekaya told me -- ayy, bruh, bruh! They tell me, Don't compare yourself to these people, right? My friend Sekaya told me it's three keys to keeping people impoverished: taking away their esteem, taking away their resources, and taking away their role models. My role models are Artists Merchants. It's less than 10 I can name in history. Truman, Ford, Hughes, Disney, Jobs, West  Bro! Broooo! Tonight, we're here to have fun. I'm standing in front of my idol, Puff Daddy. I'm standing in front of my wife, Kim Kardashian West. I'm standing in front of the future, Chance The Rapper, 2 Chainz, Jaden Smith. Bro! We are undeniably the influence, the thought leaders. I'm gonna play y'all a piece of my art and I hope y'all have a good time

 JAY-Z, JAY-Z
 In JAY-Z news
I understand what y'all tryin' to do
I brought the flutes this time, though 
Unleash the flutes on 'em, Guru
Give me some more music in the headphone
Let's get to the proceedings preceding this evening
Let's do this thing 
C'mon! H, O, V, A, I got my mojo back, baby, oh behave
Naw, naw, don't be afraid, y'all and your articles hock spit at Jay
Y'all from afar threw darts my way
What you thought, I would not have nothin' to say? Nope!
Y'all fell into the booby trap
I set the trap just to see dude react
And now, and now you's can't leave
You opened the door, God, I'm at you annually
And I'm sorry Miss Rosie Perez
I call a spade a spade, it just is what it is
But you can't give cred to anything dude says
Same dude to give you ice and you owe him some head
Shorty, it's time to wake up the dead
You sound a little naive in them articles that I read H, O, V, A, The Blueprint 2, baby, on the way
H, O, V, A, I got my mojo back, baby, oh behave
H, O, V, A, The Blueprint 2, baby, on the way
H, O, V, A, I got my mojo back, baby, oh behave Can't y'all see that he's fake, the rap version of T.D. Jakes
Prophesizin' on your CD's and tapes
Won't break you a crumb of the little bit that he makes
And this is with whom you want to place your faith
I put dollars on mine, ask Columbine
When the Twin Towers dropped, I was the first in line
Donatin' proceeds off every ticket sold
When I was out on the road, that's how you judge Hov, no?
Ain't I supposed to be absorbed in myself?
Every time there's a tragedy, I'm the first one to help
They call me this misogynist, but they don't call me the dude
To take his dollars to give gifts at the projects
These dudes is all politics, depositin' checks
They put in they pocket, all you get in return is a lot of lip
And y'all buy the shit, caught up in the hype
'Cause the nigga wear a kufi, it don't mean that he bright
'Cause you don't understand him, it don't mean that he nice
It just means you don't understand all the bullshit that he write
Is it Oochie Wally Wally or is it One Mic?
Is it Black Girl Lost or shorty owe you for ice?
I've been real all my life, they confuse it with conceit
Since I will not lose, they try to help him cheat
But I will not lose, for even in defeat
There's a valuable lesson learned, so it evens up for me
When the grass is cut, the snakes will show
I gotta thank the little homie Nas for that though
Savin' me the hassle of speakin' to half of these assholes
And I'ma let karma catch up to Jaz-O, whoa
I'm back before you had a chance to miss me
My mama can't save you this time, niggas is history
Who you know flow vicious as me?
Yet so religiously, that's why they call me Hov'
I get the spoils 'cause the victor is me 
You're an actor, you're not who you're depicted to be
You street dreamin', all y'all niggas livin' through me
I gave you life when niggas was forgettin' you emcee
I'm a legend, you should take a picture with me
You should be happy to be in my presence
I should charge you a fee
I'm Big Dog, Glenn Rob – listen, God, you a flea
And the little homie Jungle is a garden to me
What's the problem, B? You not as hard as me, nigga
Hard as we, nigga, R-O-C, nigga
That's why they follow me, they feel my pain and my agony, nigga
I won't rest 'til you on one knee
You want war, then this war's gon' be, nigga
Until you on one knee
You want war, then this war's gon' be, nigga H, O, V, A,, The Blueprint 2, baby, on the way
H, O, V, A, I got my mojo back, baby, oh behave
H, O, V, A, The Blueprint 2, baby, on the way
H, O, V, A, I got my mojo back, baby, oh behaveThe Carter is the place
And i'm running this thing like im walking in the race like they walking in place
Then I walk in that place like give me my cake
And yeah I'm a martian so give me my space
Me timmet, me timmet never date oops i mean never dat only uhhh after that have her back
I send you back to the womb you climbed out of
I milks this thing, now boy get your cows up
Shorty give me brain like she smart as brittany houser
And I stay connected like an internet browser
It's all the same, only the names will change 
Everyday it seems we're wasting away 
Another place where the faces are so cold 
I'd drive all night just to get back home  I'm a cowboy  YE! Pour a two into a one, now I'm done bitch
Niggas running they mouths, but they don't really run shit
I'm a cowboy, chicka pow pow boy
Shoot you from the floor to your fuckin-YE-YE!
Pour a two into a one, now I'm done bitch
Niggas running they mouths, but they don't really run shit
YE!
Pour a two into a one, now I'm done bitch
Niggas running they mouths, but they don't really run shit
I'm a cowboy, chicka pow pow boy
Shoot you from the floor to your fuckin eyebrow boy
2 Chainz name ringing like an Android
I think about money every time I brainstorm
And I'm in rare form if I've got Airs on
Niggas know I'm buying Guccis like they fucking Air Jordans
Outlaw lifestyle, I made a mill trapping
I'm trynna take the 'T' off and make a mill rapping
Codeine, fetti, shorty all white porcelain
Reverse cowgirl, shawty ride a nigga like a horse 2 CHAINZ!
It ain't no secret, I'mma get it
I'm over niggas heads like an ATL fitted
I'm over bitches house like I'm only gonna visit
When they try to make me stay I tell them That's some strong liquor
You know what time it is
I'm on the strong and the sizzurp
And since a young nigga, I've been on with the wiz-ord
A nigga play me wrong I put his dome in the diz-irt
I'm going on tour, I'm going be gone till November
Ruthless, ice cubes all on my sizz-erp
Pinky ring huge, such a mofuckin insult
And if you riding dubs, then my rims are much older
Two white cups, and one cup holder
Told ya, grab me a soda
Shake it like a shake-weight
Hit you with two 4x4s, that's an 8x8
And it's not that I don't like ya, but I hate hate
I know they gonna hate on this, and I can't wait 
I'ma tell you, I'ma tell you this right now
If you, if you woke up this mornin', nigga you winnin' for real
 I got a big amount, I took a different route
I am the pick of the litter
I was in juvy, they gave me community
I had to pick up some litter
I want it easy, please do not tease me
I wore my Yeezys to dinner
This is the season, I got the seasonin'
Don't make me sprinkle you niggas
I got my reasons, you wanna please me
Send me the pussy, not pictures
Met her this week and fucked her this evenin'
She turn a freak on the liquor
Yeah, I am a boss on these bitches
Yeah, I pour some Voss on these bitches
Yeah, I have no thoughts on these bitches
Yeah, rock double cross on these bitches, yeah
Dearly departed, gather today
On some Prince shit
You know what they say
Me and my safe, got a friendship
Ten on me, thin weight, flip weight, gettin' paid
Gettin' laid
Bitch made, took off sick days
6 trey, 6-4 bounce, bitch, bounce
Hood nigga, favorite spot was the Waffle House
Patty melt with the hash browns
Tryna avoid all the pat downs
Tryna avoid all the lame hoes
Weirdos in the background
Black out when I back out
Blow the horn for a pedestrian
Shawty ride like an equestrian
I bought the dress that she in
Red bottoms in his and hers
Got a Rollie in his and hers
Got a car in his and hers
Walk in the zoo and say, Pick a fur
Last night was a blur to me
This mornin' I got two with me
I don't know what to do with me
Goin' ape like the zoo with me
Got a tool with the screw missin'
Two girls in the pool kissin'
Everywhere I go, the rod with me
'Cause these niggas actin' too fishy Fuck y'all niggas on, man?
Duffle bag forever
Just left V Live
Atlanta could never die as long as Tit alive
Yeah Look, I got a big amount
I think I'm the biggest out
Got hits and I ain't even put 'em out
Lit and you can't even put it out
Got the Billboard melodies
Rap is somethin' I do on the side
Crossed over to the other side
And I didn't even have to die
Got the money and I never show it
Let a nigga try to play heroic
Michael Jackson talkin' to me in my dreams
And he say, You bad and you know it
Better shamone with my check then
I'm a J. Prince investment
Niggas love to talk reckless
Then see me like best friends
Got the sand-colored FN
And I've never seen the inside of a Marriott or a Westin
Five stars, nothin' less than
Fuck niggas on your payroll
And you let 'em know the safe code
And you knew him for a month though
But you call them niggas big bro
You could move in the Hidden Hills
And we still don't live by the same code
I'm respected everywhere I go
Nigga, long live Bankroll
Skip the rainbow, funny style shit
And it's straight to the pot of gold
Somebody, everybody know
6 God with the god flow
Yeah, yeah
When I jumped off the porch I was forced into last resorts of a temper gone short
And, of course, when that took it's course, hoarse when yelling out
Demons that fought inside of me taught society how to rejoice
Killers on side of me, privacy obviously was lost
For a piracy of the streets and my Odyssey
Caught a bullet that probably destroyed...
A good kid in a mad city, slightly annoyed
I walk down the street with no heat and run into beef when I’m just a vegan
Reeking the scent of a saint, sinners smell it then start squeezing
Pellets tumbling straight at my melon, apparent reason...
Because my cousin's cuzzin a Blood
That was Blooding in public and Kendrick seen with him last weekend, cousin
But you ain't no kin to me, probably Kendrick I'm Kennedy
Assassinate my character, shoot as your remedy
Fair enough I got enemies but I don’t bang
But that's the repercussion like when your cousin’s cuzzin a blood
And you’re by yourself at the Compton parade
Good Kid
M.A.A.D City
Life or death
Is you with me?
WassupDrumma boy, oh yeah, oh yeah boy
Warrup drum? Oh yeah, you feel me?
Oh, that’s what we doin’ man

Most these niggas try but they can’t do it
That’s unlikely

You know that is unlikely
A replicated imitation, you can’t beat me slightly
You know soon as you hear the track
No question mark or might be
I’m bishop they buy me, I’m off the hook, off the hook
Got these niggas in check mate, off the hook, off the hook
Bitch I’m bout the turnt up, let them lamers burn up
Niggas ain’t got my work at the dawn
Hustling till the sun up
Continue to set the standards, rearrange the plans
Ever since I’ve been in, I’ve been stacking them brands
From a …off, like firecrackers, I’m too hot to tame
For the e way, I’m rolling out, just stay out of my lane
 x 2
Can’t do it like me, can’t do it like me
Can’t do it like me, can’t do it like me
Can’t do it like me, can’t what
Can’t do it like me, like me, like me
Can’t do it like me, like me, like me, oh yeah
Can’t do it like me, like me, like me, oh yeah
When I slow down they say speed it up
When I speed up they say slow it down
I’m money bound
I’m so high, I could eat a cloud
Mister child, y’all … your girl is so thirsty now
My man swag like … every verse is a murder trial
Versatile, style on top of style on top of style yeah
When I say I hop the I stand for eye lens
When I fly, no eye temps, when I land, I buy them
New clothes, your hoes, ain’t shit, I’ll buy them
Dollar signs my eyes lids, now I see the big picture
HD, flat screens, TV's, same size as Paul Pierce
And ain’t no comparing us, man we do it major
And if they ain’t talking bout shit
Tell them eat so toilet paper
 x 2
Can’t do it like me, can’t do it like me
Can’t do it like me, can’t do it like me
Can’t do it like me, can’t what
Can’t do it like me, like me, like me

I wanna talk to my red and my cherry
Yes, I’m alone, and I realize when I get home
I wanna talk to my red and my cherry I want someone who like the champagne I like, my a-alike
Someone to talk me off the bridge any day or night
She teach me how to live, she ain’t afraid of life
Not easily impressed with the rich and famous life
'Cause she done been there and heard all the rumors before
She loves art, she ride out with me on my music tour
She like the herb's natural medicine, she cookin' good
She tell me everything is cool when it ain't lookin' good
For real, the world so ill, yo I want a girl so real
Who not after material wealth but get dough still
Or maybe an educator, a lady with etiquette
Who can be from out the hood or even work for the president
As long as there’s no selfishness
Yes, as long as her love for the people is deep-rooted and evident
You can be easily recruited, you’re heaven-sent
Your smile put me at ease
You’re the woman I need, but where is she? Where is he, the man who was just like me?
I heard he was hidin' somewhere I can’t see

And I’m alone, and I realize that when I get home
I wanna talk to my red and my cherry
Yes, I’m alone, and I realize when I get home
I wanna talk to my red and my cherry I hate when people write me hostile texts
On account of my lifestyle’s perception
Invade my personal life? Out of the question
What are they expectin'? I be tryin' to reply and
They never suppose I get my quiet time in?
They think forever I’m rollin' in dough, swimmin' in a pool of cash
God, wouldn’t they know or am I a fool or ass?
I’m well known, got people comin' at me mad
I had to tell homes, I don’t keep a cell phone, my bad
I drag off the L and try to silence it
The noise in my head, the curse of the talented
Strong communicator, vagabond
I’d gallivant around the equator, if that would get me off the radar
It’s so intense, I’m on my Lilo & Stitch
Pour my Pinot Grigio and Cris with some lime, what is this?
An immaculate version of Me & My Bitch by Biggie
With all respect 'cause you the only one that gets me Where is he, the man who was just like me?
I heard he was hidin' somewhere I can’t see
Where is he, the man who was just like me?

Bye bye, bye byePushed in the game at a young age
Feel me touch me as I turn the page
A little past ten, roughly about
Eleven years old dropped in the good location
My scratch is smellin sour and it's stinkin
Got a nigga seriously thinkin
How can I kill this odor, and purchase me a Lincoln?
Minimum wage flippin patties - nope
I'd rather fuck around with Coca-Cola, yola
Ice cream, candy, granola, huh
Slave for men - that's what they told me
And I'll break you off somethin suitable
Brought you a key of crack quicker than ?
? recoupable
? future black and beautiful
My partners used to be plucked and ugly
Hangin around them old squeegee boys
Man them the motherfuckers that have love for me
They straight cut for me
Deal me, touch me, L-O-V-E

Motherfucker comin from the motherfuckin.. mud
Fuck you niggas, you think I sell my soul
But I'm way too cold, motherfucker! : LeVitti Sittin in my livin room
Thinkin of, a master plan
Tryin to find a way out
Then I snatch the scratch, and laugh
So I painted me a picture
Of a life, to make a dream

Ballin outta control, ballin outta control Fresh off the showroom flo', bought me a ninety-fo'
Now I'm havin long money, like Ross Perot, so take
Notes from a big ol' ? pimp, pretty much established
Livin out of hand lavish
Throwin parties ?
With big time folks makin big time cabbage
Become a savage, get swoll by ones
Twenty a drum's established
Six figure digits, just like I tell you like
I got the whole city sewed up in stitches
Your product'll win if you gots top grade
Keep, your law-yers and your bail bondsmen paid
The word on the street's is that I done came up too fast
Motherfuckers want a piece of my soul
Playa haters wanna cut my grass
You don't wanna bring your bitch
To what type of ? out of control sittin on tickets
Million dollar spots, technology chops
And a motherfucker proud fool-assed ridiculous
Straight fuckin em up like that, throw me my strap man

And hear me

Motherfucker! Ballin outta control Interlud: LeVitti This ol' game, kids they run

So take me to this world
Now there's always time, to getcha

Of what I'm tryin to say

Every other fuckin day I'm tellin my sahies how to quit
Niggas trippin off me cause I was a young motherfucker ballin
We can get it on, we can get it on
Niggas trippin off me cause I was a young motherfucker ballin
Forty-Water, straight lettin em know
Even though my pocket's fat and my belly's bigger..
Gots to come Sic-Sic-Sic-Wid-It Throw, the ho
Y'know in a big ass gumbo pot
Full stir
Let it settle to make it lock
Horse races, trips to Vegas, frequent flier
Whassup you timah, when your ass gonna retire?
I ain't knowin
Keep tellin myself that I'mma call it quits
But I got myself
Too much motherfuckin cabbage out there runnin in the streets
Lookin up out the way for the one-time
Po-Po Penelope seriously concentratin
Noided as I watch the back for all of my chemistry
Cause fools be playa hatin
Lucrative spots and blows, investments bonds and stocks
Esquired land and crops, techno chops and Glocks
Cause niggas be tryin to make movies
When they get all in front of these bootch ass hoochies
I be like poppin the cap like a hungry mother
I ain't even gon' lie I'm to'
Twoasted, looped, to' back, souped
Plastered, puked, on the get back fully recouped
Fuck these niggas they think I'll sell my soul

If a nigga act up, pull a Desert E's out
When I pull the piece out niggas like Peace out! Golly, more of that bullshit ice rap
I got to 'pologize to Mos and Kweli 
But is it cool to rap about gold
If I told the world I copped it from Ghana and Mali? 
First nigga with a Benz and a backpack
Ice chain, Carti lens, and a knapsack
Always said if I rapped I'd say somethin' significant
But now I'm rappin' 'bout money, hoes, and rims again
And it's still about the Benjamins
Big faced hundreds and whatever other synonyms
Strippers named Cinnamon, more chips than Pentium
What'cha gon' buy next? Whatever new trend it is
I'm tryin' to spend my stacks, and I'm so broke
I look back like Damn, was I on crack?
I mean, twelve platinum chains, was I on that?
What the hell was wrong with me dog?
Sing along with me y'all Yeah, breathe in, breathe out

Breathe in, breathe out
Let them hoes fight, pull her weave out
If a nigga act up, pull a Desert E's out
When I pull the piece out niggas like Peace out! Now even though I went to college
And dropped out of school quick
I always had a Ph.D: a pretty huge dick
Ladies tired of gettin' ripped off by guys like this
And givin' head is like a whale that's usin' a toothpick
Well, I'm in the club for a limited time
Act now and get some action for a $free.99
Later on, I might charge for ménage
Heard her man was the boss of the floss
But she still want to toss me the drawers
And it ain't gon' cost me because she my caddy
Cuz she grabbed my golf balls in the club
And I'm still actin' calm den-a-muhh, she asked
Can you drive me in the hundreds where my Altima was?
While we drive she tellin' me 'bout problems with her man
Baby, I fully understand, let me help you with a plan
While he trickin' off, don't get no rich nigga
Give me some head, that'll really piss him off Yeah, breathe in, breathe out
If ya iced up, pull ya sleeves out
Push a big truck, pull ya keys out
Girls go wild and pull ya D's out
Breathe in, breathe out
Let them hoes fight, pull her weave out
If a nigga act up, pull a Desert E's out
When I pull the piece out niggas like Peace out! I blow past low-class niggas with no cash
In the four dot six, bitch you can go ask
So when I go fast popo just laugh
Right until I run out of gas or 'til I go crash
Whatever comes first I'm prepared for the worst
Whatever comes second I'll be there with my weapon
Pullin' up in the Lexuses, one on both hand
So I guess them GSes was ambidextrous
Coulda sworn her breasteses was sendin' me messages
K I need a free hand mammogram
I got weed, drink, and a Handicam
All of which is legal in Amsterdam
So say my name like Candyman
And I'ma come and fix you up like the handyman
But if you don't need a fix, girl you gotta leave

'Cause we are so far from compatible 
Suckas be all in they feelings, be hella self-conscious
Start acting irrational  He don't like me, but his bitch, she like me
She a freak but she come off as bashful 
On my neck is a key, didn't get it for free
'Cause I hustle to hard for the capital Raised in the slums 
Born in the dirt 
Low on my funds 
When my pockets was hurt 
Came up like a boss 
The truth, not false 
Cut a snake head off 
If he double cross  When I look outside my window
I see haters all around
I get a money like the wind blow
They will never see the crown Weezy wassup with it bruddah?
Tell Maestro I need to fuck over his beat real quick
Hear me? I'm the best rapper under 25, 24 inches on my ride
Ball like 23 and I shot my first .22 when I was 9 That's no lie, ho
Rappers out they mothafucking minds so I gotta go
Psycho on these niggas, call me Norman Bates with a poker face
Got the banger in my hand and I'm out to poke your face
.38 Special, grab it, let him have it, where the safe, we hungry
Housing authority saved my Section 8
My section be on the west side of Compton Cali, champ
Where the killers posted on the corner like a letter stamp
Let a rapper tell me I ain't better than whoever's out
I'mma knock 'em out his Force 1's once I air 'em out
Air jets flying 'cross the atlas, I made it momma, made a promise
Married to hip hop, and the maid of honor gonna be R&B
I'm fucking her too, so please hand me my condoms
Where the honeymoon in the mother fucking booth
You're fucking right, I'm the fucking truth
I put my hand on the bible
Swear to god if I lie, then I'll probably die tomorrow
Tell my momma don't feel sorrow cause her son was a gunner
They found my corpse with a rapper's head in my stomach
I'm right here, I ain't running even if the Iraqis w-was in back of me
Back against the wall I'm clapping them rapidly y'all
Would never stop what you can't see
It's like a red light when driving with Stevie
Wonder if you can understand or withstand the blast of my wrath
I steer the game with both hands while you crash
Like Earnhardt my heart to the fallen soldiers
You can either ride, or get rolled over
Sleeping on me, I put you in a coma
So please chill out before you meet the coldest
Starving every day, see my face where the bowl is
Bowl on my face, I walk while my mouth hold it Hold it
I'm the best rapper under 25, 24 inches on my ride
Ball like 23 and I shot my first .22 when I was 9 21 gun salute
And my soldiers killed 20 of your troops at a time
And I got about nine teens on the corner fucking with marijuana
Jive and heard about 18 rappers say that a bird can go for 17.5
Motherfuck that my sweet 16's be equivalent to about 15 pie
I was 14 when I wrote a rhyme
All I seen was 13 ghosts every time I wrote a crazy line
All these 12 bars in my verses, that's what Notorious and Pac arrived
God dammit I spit just like a Mac 11 every time
I drop jewels, you drop dimes, you pretending to be like mine
I intend to put about 10 of you rappers on channel 9
Straight up, fuck around and get ate up
Cut 'em up in 7 ways, funeral carried by 6 in 5 days you'll know I go for
Money when I sink my teeth in Carter III beats
To you from me, my son the victory is mine, I won
I'm the one
The beat was the pussy
And I cum, hard
From the unknown
I ran away, I don't think I'm coming back home
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
Like a crawlspace, it's a dark place I roam
Ain't no right way, just the wrong way I know
I problem solve with Styrofoam
My world revolves around a black hole
The same black hole that's in place of my soul, uh
Empty, I feel so goddamn empty
I may go rogue
Don't tempt me, big bullet holes
Tote semi-autos Huh, yeah
I'm keepin' it real, real
I'm keepin' it real, uh, yeah
Life gets tough, shit is getting real 
I don't know how to feel
Swallowing all these pills
Numb my real feels, uh
Devil standing here
Tryna' make a deal, uh
It ain't no deals
Feel like I'm going crazy but still took a lot to get me here
Losing my sanity up in a house in the hills, hills, hills
I ain't have anything then and I still don't have anything still, still, still, uh
Bein' me, I rock, PnB
These hoes actin' like gossip, TMZ
These drugs acting like
Mosh pits squishing me
Oh my, oh me, how they kill me slowly
Lonely, I been gettin' no peace
OD, feel like overdosing
Low key I been looking for the signs
But all I can find is a sign of the times From the unknown
I ran away, I don't think I'm coming back home
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
Like a crawlspace, it's a dark place I roam
Ain't no right way, just the wrong way I know
I problem solve with Styrofoam
My world revolves around a black hole
The same black hole that's in place of my soul, uh
Empty, I feel so goddamn empty
I may go rogue
Don't tempt me, big bullet holes
Tote semi-autos I ain't suicidal
Only thing suicide is suicide doors
Fight for survival
Gotta keep hope up, rolling good dope up 
Hold my hand, through hell we go
Don't look back, it ain't the past no more
Gonna get to the racks, all them niggas want war
Yeah, I was put here to lead the lost souls
Exhale depression as the wind blows
These are the laws of livin' in vogue
We're perfectly imperfect children
Rose from the dust, all of us are on a mission
Never gave a fuck, really came from rags to riches
Now we live it up, driving with the rooftop missin'
I don't give a fuck, really came from rags to riches
Now I live it up, driving with the rooftop missin' From the unknown
I ran away, I don't think I'm coming back home
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
Like a crawlspace, it's a dark place I roam
Ain't no right way, just the wrong way I know
I problem solve with Styrofoam
My world revolves around a black hole
The same black hole that's in place of my soul, uh
Empty, I feel so goddamn empty
I may go rogue
Don't tempt me, big bullet holes
Tote semi-autosAnd all the crazy shit I did, that'll make the best memories
Seems my old friends always make the best enemies
Can't make ends, without making bills
And you can't ask fake niggas to keep it real
Baby, I can't, I can't, I can't, argue no more
When the only thing deep about you is your throat
Why you always rock the boat?
I swear you harder to read than a doctor's note
I put my demons on the page
And put my passion on the stage
Crashing on the websites, spazzing on the websites
Driving on the wrong side, crash into the waves
Surfs up, tide's low, so you can see the stakes, drive slow
You in the presence of ghetto royalty
Do what the fuck we want and pay the lawyer fees
I'm in Paris driving in the same lane
Where Princess Diana was killed by the damn fame
The lonely king, who's only flaw is
Looking for somebody that's flawless
No fairy tale, no ending to this story book
This could very well be the same road that glory took
Or Maria Antoinette, the fall of the Rome
The ghost of the fallen king is calling me home

With Hawaiian Sophie fame, kept my name in his music I've been fucked over, left for dead, dissed and forgotten
Luck ran out, they hoped that I'd be gone, stiff and rotten
Y'all just piss on me, shit on me, spit on my grave
Talk about me, laugh behind my back but in my face
Y'all some well wishers, friendly acting, envy hiding snakes
With your hands out for my money, man, how much can I take
When these streets keep calling, heard it when I was sleep
That this Gay-Z and Cock-a-Fella Records wanted beef
Started cocking up my weapon, slowly loading up this ammo
To explode it on a camel and his soldiers
I can handle this for dolo and his manuscript just sound stupid
When KRS already made an album called Blueprint
First Biggie's your man, then you got the nerve to say
That you better than B.I.G, dick-sucking lips
Why don't you let the late, great veteran live I... will... not... lose
God's son across the belly, I prove you lost already
The king is back, where my crown at
Ill Will rest in peace, let's do it niggas Y'all niggas deal with emotions like bitches, what's sad is I love you
Cause you're my brother, you traded your soul for riches
My child, I've watched you grow up to be famous
And now I smile like a proud dad, watchin' his only son that made it
You seem to be only concerned with dissing women
Were you abused as a child, scared to smile, they called you ugly
Well life is harsh; hug me, don't reject me
Or make records to disrespect me, blatant or indirectly
In '88 you was getting chased through your building
Calling my crib and I ain't even give you my numbers
All I did was gave you a style for you to run with
Smiling in my face, glad to break bread with the God
Wearing Jaz chains, no Tecs, no cash, no cars
No jail bars Jigga, no pies, no case
Just Hawaiian shirts, hanging with little Chase
You a fan, a phony, a fake, a pussy, a Stan
I still whip your ass, you thirty-six in a karate class
You Tae-bo ho, tryna work it out, you tryna get brolic
Ask me if I'm tryna kick knowledge
Nah, I'm tryna kick the shit you need to learn though
That ether, that shit that make your soul burn slow
Is he Dame Diddy, Dame Daddy or Dame Dummy?
Oh, I get it, you Biggie and he's Puffy
Rocafella died of AIDS, that was the end of his chapter
And that's the guy y'all chose to name your company after?
Put it together, I rock hoes, y'all rock fellas
And now y'all try to take my spot, fellas
Feel these hot rocks fellas, put you in a dry spot, fellas
In a pine box with nine shots from my Glock, fellas
Foxy got you hot, cause you kept your face in her puss
What you think, you getting girls now cause of your looks
Ne-gro please, you no mustache having
With whiskers like a rat, compared to Beans you wack
And your man stabbed Un and made you take the blame
You ass, went from Jaz to hanging with Kane, to Irv, to B.I.G
And Eminem murdered you on your own shit
You a dick-riding faggot, you love the attention
Queens niggas run you niggas, ask Russell Simmons, ha R-O-C get gunned up and clapped quick
J.J. Evans get gunned up and clapped quick
Your whole damn record label gunned up and clapped quick
Shawn Carter to Jay-Z, damn you on Jaz dick
So little shorty's getting gunned up and clapped quick
How much of Biggie's rhymes is gonna come out your fat lips
Wanted to be on every last one of my classics
You pop shit, apologize, nigga, just ask Kiss Uh-huh, I've did it again niggas
Fucked up, right? Ha, I know
I know what y'all niggas asking yourself
Is he gon' ever fall off?
No... A lot of speculation
On the monies I've made, honies I've slayed
How is he for real? Is that nigga really paid?
Hustlers I've met or, dealt with direct
Is it true he stayed in beef and slept with a TEC?
What's the position you hold?
Can you really match a triple platinum artist buck by buck but only a single going gold?
If Roc-A-Fella should fold, and you're left out in the cold
Is it back to charging motherfuckers 11 for a O?
For the millionth time asking me
Questions like Wendy Williams, harassing me
Then get upset when I catch feelings
Can I get a minute to breathe? And in that minute you leave
While I'm looking at my Rol' ice spinning on my sleeve
Ugh, nice watch, do you really have a spot?
Like you said in Friend or Foe, and if so, what block?
What you doin' in L.A., with Filipinos and Eses
Latinos in Chevys, down by Pico with Frederico
I answer all y'all questions but then y'all got to go
Now the question I ask you is how bad you wanna know, BLAOW!  Uh-huh uh uh uh uh-huh uh-huh
 How we do, what?
 Uh-huh uh uh uh uh-huh uh-huh
 How we do? '98 Primo remix, and ain't nothing different
I don't know what the hell, niggas been sniffing
Jigga still dipping, chrome on the whips and
4 days out the week, find me in the kitchen
Still in the game nigga, hooked like glue
Papi gave me one pie, but it cook like two
I'm a crook like you
Cats around my way was buying brand new whips and shit, what could I do?
Knowin I'm supposed to style
I'm the hustler's poster child, rock lizards and cro-ca-dile
Live ironic and what-not
Put all that ice on the face of a watch just to make it hot
Now you see me on them stages
Rocks in the air looking like blue lasers, never fugazis
Act courageous, I smack 'em with the two aces
MAC double one, nigga, I'm troublesome
All I got for chicks hard dick and bubble gum
Flip bricks like Fred, Barney Rubble and them
It's the Roc-A-Fella clique, what's fucking with them?
Not a damn thang nigga, we doin our damn thing.. BLAOW!!!  Uh-huh uh uh uh uh-huh uh-huh
 How we do, come on

 HA! Well they call me Jay-Hova 'cause the flow is religious
And ever since I was 16 I was holding digits
I'm seeing this industry clearer
As if I had coke in the trunk and cops in the rear mirror
I slow flows y'all to death, so y'all hoes know who's best—Jigga!!
The flow be Ay Bendito, for the mamis I hable español poquito
Oh Este, I got timing like a segue
Now holla back baby
Uh-huh-huh, Jay-Z, you motherfucking right
In the darkest nights let off my gun for light
To guide y'all through, show you how it's done
I'm The Question and The Answer like Iverson
Jets be private ones, no gate to lift
So when I take flight it's from Hangar 6
Bang with this, wake up with one in your brain
And the cocaine flow's straight numbing your pain
This ain't your speed young mayne, run in your lane
So I can come through doing a hundred and change
I put one in your frame—picture that
Who's running the game? Let's get to that
I guess we one and the same
A million and one... once again
Novacane flow, hoe, you ain't know
Like a baller in an Impala, Jigga remain low
Then I pop up, and tear your block up, and kick off like soccer
In a Range Rove, twist hoes like ankles, 'til the next time, nigga
I hit y'all with a million more Ali, you thirsty on Twitter!
You boo-boo, you T'd
You turned down, you thirsty
You boo-boo! Uh, I'm tryna learn something new
I'm tryna find myself, I'm searching deep for Kendrick Lamar
I read about Napoleon Hill and try to know God
They say he the key to my blessings, and if I speak the good
Into existence, that instant my dreams will unlock
Money flow like water, I'll just wait at the dock
And by the way I'mma start, finding more light to shed
Like a small garage in your backyard
I'm back chilling with a friend of mine, she mighty fine
But I notice that her heart resides next to bitterness
Always hollering who she don't like and who she kick it with
Who she wanna fight, who wearing a weave
Who Dooney and Bourke bag is fake, who holding the keys
To the car she drove last year or who fucking on who
And who need a pap smear, getting on my nerves
But before your negative energy curve, bitch I'ma cut you off 'Cause every time you come around
You be hollering that whoop-de-whoop, blah-zay-blah
He say, she say, oh my God
Shut the fuck up... hoe
Every time you come around
You be hollering that whoop-de-whoop, blah-zay-blah
He say, she say... Uh, I'm tryna learn something new
I'm tryna surround myself with people that inspire me
Or at least inquire similar desires
To do what it T-A-K-E just to reach the T-O-P
I'm talking ideas, motivation
It's more than making, enemies, my nigga
Oh, that's not ya memo? Then tell me why you constantly stressing
On how you well connected like centipedes, my nigga
I function with you and you flaunt your pistol
Every second tell me how you pressed 'em at the Monte Cristo
Where so and so from, and what neighborhoods beefing
Who baby momma's a rat, and who got killed last weekend
That shit is mad depressing, bringing me down
Speak on somethin' with some substance that can get us both paid
Rather than telling me how these niggas jocking your style
Or his rims ain't bigger, pussy nigga, I'ma cut you off 'Cause every time you come around
You be hollering that whoop-de-whoop, blah-zay-blah
He say, she say, oh my God
Shut the fuck up... scary ass
Every time you come around
You be hollering that whoop-de-whoop, blah-zay-blah
He say, she say Uh, I'm tryna learn something new
I'm tryna better my chances of becoming a star
I'm tryna feel the vibe of Mona Lisa
Studying art... now paint that picture
Life behind bars, remember the very day I got caught?
I murdered a rapper, and you filed the police report?
See what I was taught, family is all I need
But indeed them too can run me right up a tree
Constantly talking shit 'bout the next relative
Wanting me to take sides, but I'd never give in
Ever since grandma died, everyone parted ways
Argue on holidays, left my uncle in prison
For 15 years, no one paid him attention but moms
Yeah, my momma as loyal as any sister would come
Come to my house just to yap about your own people
Dang, and if your blood wasn't running through my veins
I would prolly cut y'all off too, yep 'Cause everytime y'all come around
Y'all be hollering that whoop-de-whoop, blah-zay-blah
He say, she say, oh my God, shut the fuck up
Keep it running, Ali
Every time you come around
You be hollering that whoop-de-whoop, blah-zay-blah
He say, she say So tell 'em, Shut the fuck up!
Tell 'em, Shut the fuck up!
Yeah, bitch, you boo-boo, you T'd
You turnt down, you thirsty
Tell 'em Shut the fuck up!
Tell 'em Shut the fuck up!
Yeah, nigga, you boo-boo, you T'd
You turnt down, you thirsty
You thirsty, you boo-boo
You T, you turnt down
You boo-boo, you T'd

You thirsty, you T'd
You boo-boo, you turnt down
You boo-boo, you T'd
You turnt down, you weak
You weak, yo’ bitch weak
Yeah 
You boo-boo, you T 
Keep all that What is HiiiPoWeR?
HiiiPoWeR is the way we think, the way we live
See it’s known today that the human race is nothing
No morals, no standards
What we’re about to do is raise the level of expectations
No, you don’t have to have a lot of money
You don’t have to be rich
But you will be rich in mind and spirit
Some say it’s as big as a crew, some say it’s as big as a gang
HiiiPoWeR, we stand for it as if it’s as big as a religionStop pretending, I know when you're lying
I know there's someone else taking all your time
And honestly, I don't blame you, it's fine
Tried keeping us together but you got other things in your mindShit
Uh, it's been a long time comin'
But I'm still here
Everybody talking 'bout they numb or something 
Can you feel hell
All this fake shit around me is this some real hell?
All this sober shit around me is there some pills hell?
For real, I need to know
I need to know
My mama tell me that I need to let 'em go
She say the syrup in these pills finna kill me
But sometimes I think it brings out the real me
Sometimes I think it brings out the concealed me
Sometimes I think it exposes and reveals me
So what happens when the real meets the real
What happens when Juice meets the pills
Uh-uh-uh, yeah

I rapped on another beat that's some extra shit
You niggas gon' have to deal with the mess of it
I thought I told yo' ass not to mess wit' it
I see this shit before I say it, telepathy
It's like I talk to my conscious, I say what it's tellin' me
Anything besides money, eh, it's kinda irrelevant
I can't focus without codeine, my medicine
I sip it until I'm slurrin' and spittin' impediments
I'm ballin' to the point where I think I need a Letterman
Westwood at the gates of London, he just had to let 'em in
I'm here, spazzin' on every single track he pass
You run up, I leave you leakin' on a maxipad
I'm ballin', hard, these other niggas on the bench
I swear, they need to stay where they at
Nigga, I'm takin' over the world, a map for a map

I'm up to bat, throw a fastball, it's a hit
I hit a lick, then I hit a hit on yo' bitch I don't miss
Listen, I heard yo' bitch on my hitlist

Careers is arsenic 
My flow badder than bad women
I rock shows like Kravitz and John Lennon
Yo' sins ain't forgivin'
I'm the rap god, call me Juice Allah
Did I take it too far?
Did I take two bars, to get on Mars?
To more like  
I got a little tongue twisted, but I'm still gifted
Still spittin', still rippin' writtens
This premonition is really killin' it
And these niggas ain't shit
But Civics, me I'm Bentley

I sold my soul then bought it back, I finessed 'em 
You run up on me, choppa holy it'll bless 'em 
He talking stupid 'till they shoot him, that's my weapon 
I got a couple of bars I could spit
Maybe I'll just use 'em in this shit
Or maybe I'll just use 'em in a skit
My first guess, they wanted shit
My next project, it's gon' be harder
My arm in the rim, really, I feel like Vince Carter
I'm at yo' head nigga, I feel like a barber
You on the bench nigga, and I am a starter
I die for my shit nigga, feel like I'm a martyr

All the legends, where they at? They all die
Well, I don't wanna be a legend up in my prime
But, I know it's still prime time
Stars, how I shine
When they align with the planet, you know some shit is goin' on
I transform like Omegatron, when my favourite song is on
Fuckin' that bitch like the Ramadan

Lord forgive me, Lord forgive me
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe

I'm fuckin' this industry hard
I'm bagging this money, tea-bagging your honey
You thought I was fresh out the yard
Don't cry to me dummy, you're a lightweight
They tell me you nice and I'm like wait
Go get me a knife, you're looking like steak
And when the stakes are high, I stake out for days
And when the water reside, you're Bobby Boucher
But we ain't thirsty nigga, never alert me, nigga
I got a P89 in a suitcase
I know you heard me, nigga, this is a burpee, nigga
Lyrical exercise
Right now, homie, I'm in the extra vibe
Pipe down, on the curb, when you heard that I got these words
To the upper echelon, that's excellent I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
Lord forgive me, Lord forgive me
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe

I would share it but today I'm yelling
Bitch, don't kill my vibe; bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe; bitch, don't kill my vibe Up in the clouds, me and my spouse
Rumors on the ground gettin' too loud
Please turn them shits down, can't hear myself think
Turbulence, shit, almost spilled my drink

Running through that bitch like it's my house
All up in the hall like a mall

Fall back, bitch, I got a lot on my plate

Kill my vibe, that's your motherfuckin' funeral Between you and me, turn eulogy to urinals, niggas pissed off
I ministered this generation by far
Leader of the new school, on my toes like a ballerina
Who knew I'd be Black Swan?
World in my palms, ironically
I am the Globetrotters' best
'Cause I didn't drop the ball
Told niggas when I was 16 that I'd write a 16
To put a nigga right on the big screen
In the paddy wagon with six teens
Should have been in the pen but now my pen write with morphine
I heal niggas, touch down with more fiends
I kill niggas, audio crack, khakis to meal ticket
Cardio lap, was running for dear life but now I'm running the map
Bitch, I'm here nigga
Picture lil' ole me giving a fuck for what a fuck nigga gotta say
Nigga you never be Jay, never be Nas, never be Snoop nor Dre
You ain't get killed in Vegas or in a Suburban
Nigga, Puff Daddy wasn't your favorite
So many washed up with detergent
But I don't dry tears, I just aim at them on purpose
Like blah, Mini-14 like blah
Empty out another magazine like blah
Let a young nigga get by
I kill 'em all when they try to kill my vibe
I am the bad, the good God, the last the hood got
The last that would try to pass a good job
If Shawn's a black Beatle then I need a 10 second drum solo

It's 
How many niggas bit the soul? 'Bout 
How many hoes did I bone? 'Bout 
Uh-uh, uh-uh, it's , uh-uh
There's  ways to die, choose one
 Lot of people askin' 'bout the money I made, even Just Blaze
How are they for real, is them niggas really paid?
Rappers I met or dealt with direct
Is it true he won't send a beat tape until he get a check?
What's the position you hold?
Can you really match the Neptunes, check
By check if H to the Izzo is the only single that went gold?
If Roc-a-Fella shit fold and you move back to the 'Go
Is it back to ghost producer for D. Dot on the low?
For the millionth time askin' me
Questions like Toni Braxton, harassing me
Like you don't care about my son's feelings?
Can I get a minute, you wack bitch? I ain't gotta jack shit
You heard Takeover, who running this rap shit?
Ugh, fake tits, shut up and make hits
Can't we all just get along, spread love like Take 6?
What, you doin' beats in LA for Eminem and Dr. Dre?
Them niggas sold ten mill, I'm trying to get paid
We do this shit for entertainment
Bring guns to the arraignment
While the judge in the chamber
Let one up out the chamber, BLAOW! How many years did I wait? About 
How many niggas tryin' to hate? About 
But when a nigga count his cake, it's 'bout  '04, College Dropout, I make the game different
I don't know what the hell y'all niggas been sniffin'
'Ye still flicking, hoes is my addiction
Five days out the week, you'll find me in the kitchen
Smashing the game, nigga, unlike you
'Cause these beats change the game and the hook's right too
I'm a crook like you
Cats back in the Chi was buying tracks for dirt cheap
Man, what could I do?
Knowing I supposed to style, I'm the fly boy poster child
'Bout to be on Oprah now
It's ironic and whatnot how I put no ice on the Bulgari watch
Just to make it hot
Now you see me on stages, my hit resumes is two pages
For them niggas who played us
Feet just raises, booming like Master Aces
Stand Up, number one, and there's more to come
All I got for hoes is hard dick and bubble gum
While y'all brick like Fred, Barney Rubble and them
Chi-Town in this bitch, what's fucking with them?
Not a damn thing, nigga, we doing our damn thing, BLAOW!
Didn't your momma tell you not to mess with them aliens?

But scratch that shit, Young Money, we the greatest
Add another check to my checkings and savings

Album is on the Way, checkVerse 1: Drake I love these cold nights my breath light and I slide through to your crib
Got my mom's car my phone off cause I don't want to leave here
Girl the moon peakin' the sun leavin' let's watch it disappear
Got the heat on the music low so you all up in my ear
I keep yawnin' and yawnin' like I'm gettin' tired
You keep telling me that I need to head home but I don't gotta work so it's fine
It was just eight but now it's three what happened to the time
It don't even matter we having fun so really girl I don't mind
Got my diamonds all on my neck and all this gal 'o mine on my face
With yo' soft lips and your long hair that go down to your waist
If we fuck now I might pull it I don't care if it's fake
Oh you got to work in the morning girl you might show up late
It's been one hell of a night with you I don't mind it at all
Heard you break hard so I'm prepared to pick up the pieces that fall 
Ladies and gentlemen, yours truly DJ Drama. For the first time ever, a one-on-one cypher, a one-on-one battle, two MC's. One has sold over 80 million records, a thousand features, numerous Grammy's and BET Awards, and the other one, hasn't done a goddamn thing. Let's go Forget all my adversaries, I puff the baddest mary

Double up her like a gambler, streetsweeper, I'm a janitor
Y'all weak like a calendar, heh, beyond weak
Yeah, I'm getting close to a billion in arm reach
Yeah, all I could see from my building is palm trees
Yeah, Katrina had us trapping out a RV
Heh, we dripping, and y'all weak

And bloodstains all over your offspring
I think the gang and police they all linked
Hold up, why you flinching slime? Call your henchmen slime
You know I draw down, you draw attention slime
Fiend searching in a haystack for syringes slime
D-boy got em flipping like some ninjas slime
See em tweakin', see em crying, see em limping slime
That some symptons slime, I can prevent em slime
Split your head right in two like split decision, slime
I been through hell and back, came back in mint condition slime
Hold up, now its time to drop the window, slime
Toss out your demo, I ain't even like your intro, slime, haha

Are you familiar with this feeling
No concealing
Its out all out in the open
The type of life you first timers could soak in
That virgin pussy's waiting
And Im about to poke it
Im underrated, I am Ricky Henderson to Oakland
But im about to sleep em, Acquire em', and keep em'
I require a retainer to retire them and sweep em' in a Dust pan
New guy, Too fly, who buy seven cars
Dubai seven stars
You die heaven's our's
And you don't see the jag drop in here
Its like im chasing my dad the way I tag pops in in here
Lets see how many carrots we can do
Mixin' farm land green with that paratrooper blue
Who are you? You confused homie, that's a pensive look there
Where those are dark oak floors and that expensive cookwear
Thats a 07 but I got a even newer ride
Doors all suicide
I should be your tour guide
Im expedia flown
Wikepidia known
Obtain a key to your home
And take a seat on your throne
I been through it all
Spend it all to do it all
You are not me man I could never be you at all
Cause you just stupid dog
The A8 super large
And yea you got a range but that shit ain't even supercharged Aight check, flow switch, Flow switch I don't ever pay a percentage of the retail
Only thing Im paying is attention to the detail
Schedule can change at the mention of a email
Booking up a show with some tension with a female
My Dad said to get rich you have to dig deep
Cause Drake these some big streets
And you are not Big Meech
And you are not Rayful
And this is not DC
Four years later quarter million off of TV
You was having hoop dreams
I was drafting group schemes
Take us off of bus kids and turn us into coupe teams
Well woop there it is
Oops now my troops clean
First car Audi drop, Color like a poutine
Im feelin grown up, Don't ask me for id, like you know who I be, bouncer I know the owner
I never go, I felt out of place at a school dance
Cause they know the layout of the mall like I knew france
Inside and out, Therefore I been Hiding out
And you drive cars that I been riding out
Correction I been rode em out
Been showin' out, sold off shit the stories you've been told about
And dog, I been old amount
Young money old accounts
Degrassi my royalties
Homie you just owed an once
No weight move
My shoulder counts
Man, I don't even know my name anymore man Eeuungghh Uhh
I'm elevated
I'm floating on cloud nine times out of ten
You can find me with a cup in my hand
Filled to the rim with oil
Throwing up the middle finger
But I'm not an alcoholic I'm just a serious social drinker
Heavy thinking, thumper toting, don't trust nobody but I
Cause the scandalous be plotting, and if they could they would try
Like last night at the club
God as my witness
I was sitting at my table
Minding my own business
Living it up to the highest
Like every day is Christmas
A sucker tried to try us
Hating on our riches
I guess they didn't like us
Cause we got all the bitches
But they didn't want to fight us
Cause my niggas we the shiznit
Fuck compromising, explaining, and trying to reason
We'll catch 'em outside of the club and leave them niggas leakin'
I be beastin One lonely beasty I be!
 When my money was hecka small
I made it look like it was tall
Punch a hater up in his jaw
If he didn't want to shake my paw
When I used to push that raw
On the other side of the law
Where the prices fluctuate and go up and down like a see-saw
Nah this ain't no hee-hah
Clown shit, this real
I slap a busta with the heel of my hammer up out my skrill
I take a uptempo track
Put some game behind my rap
I'm like that
Motherfucker I'm a mack
Hide yo back
Before she fuck around and get snatched
I'm from the flats
The Hillside to be exact
Cattin off and sipping ain't what this playa do son
There's only like seven real niggas left on this earth
And I'm one of them
I be beastin, bitch da man'e, mannish little old heathen
The rawest nigga speaking
They call me Earl Stevens Bosses do what they want
Suckas do what they can
Aauuaauuaaggghh
I'm feelin like Tarzan
Gotta pocket full of money and I'm confident
Gotta fifth of landy cognac and some romulan
Some romulan?
Yeah, some cheebah
It's handling but my strain of choice, is sativa
When she was young she wasn't looking all that tight take Meagan Good for example
Now she looking right
I'm about to take her down tonight
I be beastin in the bed
I like 'em dark, light and bright
Yellow-bone and red
I'm loaded and I'm twisted and I'm faded!
In the function gettin' white boy wasted!

You know, a lot of groundwork has been set. Lot of plans have been put in motion. Now it's only a matter of time. I feel like that time is here. You know, I said it before and I can say it again, man: every street nigga's not a rapper. Every rapper's not a street nigga. But when you get them two things together, in the right of rightest of ways, it's like magic, baby. So 2 Chainz, pass me a cup. About half full. I'm good with that. And let me do what I do best, man. They don't call me Drama F. Kennedy for no motherfuckin' reason. See, I'm here on this Codeine Cowboy with the hottest in the city without a gangster grill
When you think of Jay-Z, what comes to mind? I think, um… Two things. Roc-a-fella Records. Um, building the brand and the label. And also, the—the brand of Jay-Z. To say, “I weathered the storm. I’m not just a rapper. I’m a—a CEO, I’m a entertainer, um, I’ve done… I have a vodka company, I have a clothing company… Um… I have, uh, 47 employees—um, um—as far as Roc-a-fella Records. And I’m not sta- stopping here. I have a S-Dot Carter shoe coming out, uh… I’m on—I’m doing the first Showtime special ever in fifteen years.” Um… Jay—I don’t think Jay’s done. And I think we have a lot to foresee 


Wait King of my city, king of my country, king of my homeland
King of the filthy, king of the fallen, we livin' again
King of the shooters, looters, boosters, and ghettos poppin'
King of the past, present, future, my ancestors watchin'
King of the culture, king of the soldiers, king of the bloodshed
King of the wisdom, king of the ocean, king of the respect
King of the optimistics and dreamers that go and get it
King of the winner's district and geniuses with conviction
King of the fighters, king of the fathers, king of the belated
King of the answer, king of the problem, king of the forsaken
King of the empathy, you resent me, king of remorse
King of my enemies, may they fall defeat, I rejoice
King of the skyscrapers, dodgin' haters, broke religion
Nine faces, go against 'em, I erased 'em with precision
I embrace them with collision, kings did it
King's vision, Black Panther, King Kendrick, all hail the king!
I dropped a million tears
I know several responsibilities put me here
I don't pedal backwards, but I live old-fashioned
The lens that I'm lookin' through
Won't prescribe me the right glasses, masses are now free
Ashes I'm dumpin' out, 'bout to spread all 'cross seas
Sisters and brothers in unison, not because of me
Because we don't glue with the opposition, we glue with peace
But still'd fuck up your organization if any beef
What do you stand for?
Are you a activist? What are your city plans for?
Are you a accident? Are you just in the way?
Your native tongue contradictin' what your body language say
Are you a king or you jokin'? Are you a king or you posin'?
Are you a king or you smokin' bowl rocks to keep you open?
Because the king don't cry, king don't die
King don't lie, king give heart, king get by, king don't fall
Kingdom come, when I come, you know why
KING! KING! KING! KING! KING!
I am T'Challa
Even though you're all alone
All alone when I am gone
I just wanna keep you warm
I'm coming back, I'm coming back
Yes, I'll be there, yeah, yes, I'll be there
'Cause when I'm all alone, I think about your face
And how I wanna touch, I'm so far away 
All I wanna do is give all of me now
Are you ready? Are you ready? Yeah Don't go missing, fly with me
Don't go missing, fly with me, fly with me
Don't go missing, fly with me

Don't go missing, fly with me, fly with me I'm aware that we just met
I don't wanna leave you yet
Promise that I won't forget
I'm coming back, I'm coming back
Yes, I'll be there, oh, yes, I'll be there, oh
About to board a flight, sitting at my gate
I just wanna touch you but I'm so far away 
All I wanna do is give you all of me now
Are you ready? Are you ready? Oh Don't go missing, fly with me
Don't go missing, fly with me, fly with me
Don't go missing, fly with me

Don't go missing, fly with me, fly with me, fly

Hey, whats up doc? Now I was raised in a sandbox, next to you and her
You was holding the handgun, she was giving birth
To a baby boy to be just like you, I-I wonder what's that worth
I-I wonder if you ever knew that you was a role model to me first
The next day I-I woke up in the morning, seen you on the news
Looked in the mirror, then realized that I-I-I had something to prove
You told me Don't be like me, just finish watching cartoons
Which is funny now cause all I see is Wile E. Coyotes in the room And I run it 
And I run it 
And I run it 
And I run it 
That's ironic 
Ironic 
That's ironic

Popular pie plant pictured here...
Wile E. Coyote! Wile E. Coyote! This shit make a nigga just wanna write
Reminisce when I had the morning appetite
Apple Jacks and after that I hit the TV Guide
Animaniac the only thing that gave me peace of mind
I’m a maniac when aiming at the enemy that lied
Tell a story that I'll never grow to 25
Not to worry, every warrior will come and see euphoria
And that's a covenant I put on every tribe
Ain't nobody gon' tie your shoe
Nobody gon' abide by your rule
Nobody holding your gun, how come your tongue say killa then kill my mood
Light speed living in the world you know
Little old me, feeling like a live wire
Bet I put some new tires on a lightning bolt
'Til I wreck into a pole, like a right to vote
I'm from the bottom of the jungle
Living in the bottom of the food chain
When you get a new chain, nigga take it from you
A new name, want stripes, and you a zebra look-alike
Hope another homicide don't numb you and none do
Things we will never learn soon
In the era where we wanna earn soon
That's a error, you can smell it in the air and everybody really doomed
That's why I'm backdooring you motherfuckas
All y'all can suck my dick
All them days at the county building
I'm 'bout to make my mama rich

Discounts never did amount to a check
That ya ass couldn't cash when the shit bounce
Everything dismounts, niggas gon' flip that car
AKs for the whole hood
House lick went down perfect
Two shots to the head he deserved it
I overheard it hit my bed with a bowl and remote control
Dark Wing Duck lost service
Mama said I'd better duck, she's nervous
Drama all up in the cut, hit the curtains
I mean don't intervene with no gun machine
This block stay jerking, the feds stay lurkin'

Get a toe tag when you play tag with a task of a new 
Everybody wanna know my life

Mufucka hope y'all amused!
I did wrong, karma came
Crackers gave me ball and chain
Friends, enemies all the same
State, fed, both can hang
Nobody can mute me
But I never said nobody can't shoot me
Just another stat to the white folks
Still whip work to the white yolk, absolutely!
Everyday feel like the one before
Hunt the money, don't hunt the hoe
If you do what you always done
Then you get what you always got
You dumb buffoons!
I ain't seen the back of my eyelids
For about the past 72 hours
Hand on my heart, face to the hood
I pledge every word you ever heard was honest
Yeah this me, no mic
No cameras, no lights, just pain
Mama, how much trauma can I sustain?
Dirty money come with lots of stains
Road to riches come with lots of lanes
Just another player with lots of game
Never had shit, got lots to gain... Just another player with lots of game
Never had shit, got lots to gain NoneLondon bridges are falling down
Not bridges but britches when Jigga’s in town
Lady, show me your knickers
I might let you kick it if you don’t tell the missus
Quick, run, before the tabloids come
Run from the night or we end up in The Sun
I’m just taking the piss — unless you’re gonna do it
Oh Nelly’s gone so Makaveli
Bring two packs of condoms when you come to the tele
Tell me if this is true

How many bitches wanna fuck this nigga named Snoop
Doggy, I'm all the above
I'm too swift on my toes to get caught up with you hoes
But see it ain't no fun
If my homies can't get a taste of it
Cause you know I don't love em Woo! Hey, now you know
Inhale, exhale with my flow
One for the money, two for the bitches
Three to get ready and four to hit the switches

So back up, bitch, because I'm struggling
Just get on your knees and then start juggling
These motherfucking nuts in your mouth
It's me, Warren G the nigga with the clout It ain't no fun if the homies can't have none

Come to the beach and find
I live where all the little seagulls fly
See, baby, I'm so high
All I need you to do is just shut up and ride Me an' Mac is just two niggas from the same hood
Fell from the same tree, cut from the same wool
I'm just the young lion and he the young bull
Not Sammy the Bull, that pistol on my hip, now I gotta hand in the pool
I had a Lammy in school
I think it was diablo red
I'm t-i-red, I'm T.I red
You D.I-ed because of what you said
Chyee, I'm sharp as an image
And I keep it bumpin' like a mothafuckin' blemish
Two twins drink me up like Guinness
When I'm finished, I say, Billion
When I'm finished they say, Weezy, you killed it
Hop on your shit and say, Weezy, you healed it
So fly I got wings tattooed on me
A gun glued on me, but I pop ya in ya stomach
Now I got yesterday's food on me
Now that was real rude, homie
And I smell like a weed plant
Young Money mothafucka, where that cheese at?
I keep the blammer in the drawer with the pajamas
I keep the ammo in the bananas
I keep the standards high as the Canyon
I treat the Grammy's like some medallions
I treat the randoms like some companions
I treat the weed like some azaleas
I got more value than I got failure
I got more flings than I got flair
I don't dream if I do not have nothing to wear
You see what I mean, and that's why you stare
I know you believe, I know you beware
I know she a fiend, and this an affair
If momma a queen, and poppa a bear
You run out of steam, you run out of stairs
I run in Supreme and get something rare
She run to the team, and now she a player
We live on the edge, we die in the air
We sick in the head, but pockets is well
We tiptoe on eggs, we out of our shell
Our vision is red, the eyes are as well
We can't pay attention, we got to pay bills
It doesn't make sense if it's not making mills
We do not take pictures, we're not taking L's
If y'all love to listen, then I hate to tell
If y'all scared to visit, then I take it there
If heaven is real, then y'all fake as hell
Cut off your heels and bounce on your tail
I'm on a mission, survival is real
Man, fuck how I fix it, admire the repairs
I'm talking six but my mind is on twelve
Poppin' prescriptions on top of the hill
Even the devil advised me to chill
I told that nigga, stay out of my hair
She just want to fuck in the throne
Shit get too deep and they dug up your bones
I'm sippin' that Sleep and I'm smoking that Gone
When you reach your peak, we gon' cut off your arms
She sniffin' that King and she mix it with Kong
Her clit got a ring, and my dick got a horn
This is what I call a risk and reward
We cutting it close, give the ninja the sword
Fuck what they think, man these niggas don't know us
This shit is sick and it get in your pores
And then you a corpse, and then it's the morgue
Me, I'ma hustle until it's the Forbes
I swore, it was no more than a chore
The house by the water, condo by the shore
I'm sure, I'm all about that manure
Cooler than leather and hot as velour
I'm not the one, when it is war
I'm on the front until combat is done
And I got your tongue, stomp on it once
Then smile at your young, they see I'm having fun
Shit don't get brazy 'til I say go brazy
Run up on your haven and pop at your nasal
Your baby gon' take me straight down to the basement
Gun to the head, she get down to the basics
No dramatization, we popping these gauges
Even the neighbors gon' feel the vibrations
Behind desperation, it's just in our nature
So cold-hearted, perspiration turn to glaciers
Ovations, better be loud and bodacious
And then I'ma take me a bow and be gracious
Wipe the gun off with my towel
Throw it in the crowd and then take a pow at the spacious
I'm out of my mazes, I'm out of my cages
I'm out of the labels, I'm kind of escapist
I profit, I praise it, I spend it, I save it
I buy me a nation, you renting on Avis
I'm in it, I sit it, I did it, you said it
You killing, you playing, I'm friendly, I'm faded
I get way too high to get through the hiatus
You look in my eyes and my pupils dilated
I'm true to my ratings, I'm glued to my statements
I just want to dive in the pool of my payments
I'm in and outrageous, I'm rippin' out pages
You runnin' your mouth, seein' how quick you can chase it
And then you rephrase it, we stick to invasions
The stick is malicious, equipped with a laser
The temperature blazin', the tension is raisin'
You smell the dead once, gotta live with the fragrance
Sickness is real, the meds is too tasty
Death is related, happy we made it
Keeping it dirty like Sanford and Grady
The Young Mula Baby, I'm back from the 80s
Dedication, sick, shit My favorite movie quote is You got 14 bricks in that bag right there? That's my favorite movie quote. That was Cam talking to, uh you know Mitch and all them, that was uh, damn I always forget the name of the movie and it's my fucking favorite quote but it ain't my favorite movie, but like that's my favorite movie quote.

Waking up in Amsterdam with the boy

You would probably fly out to Japan for the boy
You would probably kill another man for the boy
You would probably...
You would probably lie 'bout it on the stand for your boy
Put the Bible to your right hand for the boy
That's why you ain't never gotta worry 'bout the boy
You know you got...
You know you got that really good insurance on the boy
You just gotta pack a bag and hurry to the boy

I very often think about you and the Beatles, not because the music sounds alike, but because they were real envelope-pushers, you know, they were always about what's next, telling the audience. They were not afraid to be ahead of their audience, and I feel like that's what you try to do. I mean, this album is a lot about arts, and things that kids not necessarily would be interested in. The the truth is, as far as hip-hop and the arts, we were like cousins, you know. If you think about those days with Fab Five Freddy was with Madonna and Basquiat and everything. You know, we all went to those clubs--that’s when hip hop was more underground. The arts and hip-hop really partied together, but when arts started becoming part of the gallery it was this separation. But we pretty much came up together. You have a song on your record called “Tom Ford.” I'm sure some people are thinking, why is he on some white, gay designer’s dick? What’s going on there? Pause. Let me clarify that: I am not... I meant that metaphorically. But the line that I think says alot, you say, “I don’t pop molly, I rock Tom Ford.” You know, everybody else is talking about doing ecstasy, and you’re, “I don’t do that; I get shit done. I’m in business.” Man, I’m just gonna take you around with me-- To explain your shit? Yeah. Thank you. Thank you, sir. It could help you with Harry Belafonte. You had a feud. Show the picture. I mean, this is very bad what happened with the you and Harry because, I mean, look at look at this. He’s 86, and you’re 43? So he’s literally twice your age and it’s a draw. He got on your case because he, I remember when they did this with Michael Jordan, you remember that, when they were saying to Michael Jordan: “You're the king of the negroes; get more involved, do more.” And, you know, that upset you, and I don't blame you for being upset. Yeah, I just didn’t think it was the correct venue. If it was something, really like a real problem, you know, I'm not a very difficult to find, especially for someone of that stature. He can reach out to me and we can have a conversation we’ll do some good together. But, you know, I just thought that it was a bit of grandstanding to me, and I didn’t appreciate especially dragging my wife into it was a bit of a low blow-- And Bruce Springsteen... I really like Bruce Springsteen. Harry was on our show once. He was iconic, as he is, and I don't know if you ever saw this clip, but I wanted to get it for you. This is from a 1968 television special he did with Petula Clark, and this was a giant controversy in 1968 because she touched him. Show the clip to show you what I'm talking about. This is what people we upset about. Can you imagine, that’s where the country was? That just that she had his arm...and you see the look in his eyes, it's like, “you know, you dumb English broad, you’re gonna get me lynched. I’m just putting it in perspective; that’s where he’s coming from. I feel like a lot of this record is about the love/hate relationship you have with fame, certainly that first track, the title track. “Holy Grail,” it’s about acknowledging that you’re dancing with this drug, you know, and that people have lost their lives behind it, you know, this fame thing, and where to draw the line and how to maintain a sense of yourself within it. We look at all the people that came before us who are no longer here with us, you know, have been in this dance with fame. And it’s just me just really thinking out loud and vocalizing and hopefully dealing with it in some ways. It’s sorta like my therapy. It’s kinda strange to have a conversation with like three people, like I'm ignoring y’all. I gotta make eye contact. And they’re all gay, by the way. Think of us as your backup group in waiting. We’ll bring them in in a few minutes. You’re the first guest we’ve ever had who said that. Everyone else is like, “Fuck them.” They never even think about that. Okay, so I was doing a little math and based on when your first album came out, you will be eligible for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in seven years. Is it based on your first album? Twenty five years from your first album. So in seven years you will be eligible for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. I'm sure you'll be getting in first ballot unless there's some steroids-- I am not going! You’re not going? Nah, I’m just-- You’ll be going. Who would you like to induct you? Um, Obama. Well... I cheated. Let’s say he’s busy... It’ll be all right. He owes me, he owes me a couple. He owes me a couple. I noticed that one of the talking points from conservatives after the Trayvon Martin trial was, why are we talking about this one tragedy when hundreds of black kids are being shot in Chicago. But over the weekend the Congressional Black Caucus did a two-day summit there, and they talked about this very issue the conservatives say they're never talking about. It was covered by NPR, MSNBC, Chicago media, C-SPAN, not Fox News. It seems like Fox News doesn't want to allow this fact in that they are actually talk-- It’s total concern trolling. What? Concern trolling. It's, you know, saying, well you know shouldn't--don't worry about this thing, worry about this other thing, but you don't really care about the other thing you just wanna change the subject. And I think that the it's also bizarre to act like people don't care about violence in in inner cities or affecting black communities in the United States. I think it's a hugely important issue, especially in local politics where crime issues are actually dealt with. But it really it really is just an effort to change the subject. It's also the case, and this goes back to our other argument, one of the things Republicans have been able to do is cut budgets, so there are a lot fewer police officers in every city in America. And social workers, and other people who might take a preventive kinda situation. And also, by the way, that’s why unemployment is too high; we've created on a private sector jobs, but the Republican priorities have cut over a million have public sector jobs, and that’s cops and others. So they’ve caused that kind of problem by denying the cities the resources that they could use to try to do with the problem. But I think over-policing is part of the problem. I mean, look at New York City and look at stop and frisk. I mean, policing in communities of color...I mean, I don't know, I can’t talk this better than you can, but I’m curious or your opinion, Jay Z-- I don’t really want to scare America, but the did the real problem is there's no middle class, right? So that the gap between have and have-nots is getting wider and wider. Let me just finish this point because I do want to scare them a little bit: It's going to be a problem that no amount of police can solve, because, you know, once you have that sort of oppression, you know, and that gap is widening, it’s inevitable that something is going to happen. I agree with that, but that does not mean you don't need police in the short term, and I completely disagree: Stop-and-Frisk is an abuse of people’s rights, but the African Americans I talk to, and that including those in Congress, don't want fewer police--they want better policing. But they want more policing. It’s like Bill said, “Oh, the ambulance came very quickly because you were in a white neighborhood; a sad joke with some truth to it. So denying them the resources is the problem, the notion that because some police have misbehaved you want fewer police. I don't know any significant percentage in the African-American community... Well, more jobs would be better than police. We won’t need police... You need them both. I think, again, that’s a mistake. More jobs, those are going to help, but in the short term people want police stations. We are very unfair to people live in public housing. It was built badly, and they were put in there, but they deserve much more protection. The overwhelming majority of perfectly innocent, honest people-- They deserve to get out of there. Public housing was a temporary stop, right? I grew up in Marcy Projects; public housing was a temporary stop until you got yourself together, you moved on. But even if you’re there for a couple years, you don’t want to be unpoliced. I'm all for that, low-income affordable rental housing was my number one goal--it's another thing that the Republicans, through the Tea Party, have absolutely cut off, unfortunately-- But I don’t think Stop-and-Frisk is a few bad apples. That’s an institutionalized racism that the NYPD has been conducting for years. They stopped more young black men than there are young black men in New York last year. I don’t seem them stopping and frisking Wall Street bankers--they have tons of cocaine on them. Hahahahaha. You’re fighting a straw man. Of course Stop-and-Frisk, the way they’re doing it, is wrong, but answer is not fewer police. You hear people in the African-American community in New York complaining about Stop-and-Frisk, not get the cops outta here. They want the cops to be there and to be better behaved. I think it's also important to remember: crime is still falling. We've had a massive improvement-- The murder rate is at a hundred year low. Yeah, so I think you know inequality’s a big problem in a number of ways, but a lot of people were afraid when we went to the recession in 2008 that the progress we’d made on crime be reversed, and actually this is one social indicator that just keeps getting better. And also black people are the primary victims of crime disproportionately, and that’s why they don’t want to see the police taken away. They want them improved but the answer is not to remove them. If the murder rate is at a hundred year low, why do we need to do so much stopping and frisking; why do we need drones with the police department; why we're building a wall in Mexico. It begs a lot of questions. Why are we such a police state now? Don't punish every city in New York for Mike Bloomberg's tics. The fact is-- And Ray Kelly’s, let’s don’t forget about Ray Kelly. Obama wants him as the Homeland Security Czar. It is not true in the whole country that police departments are doing that. The Los Angeles police have gotten a lot better since the days of-- But you’re from Massachusetts. We saw, when the Douchebag Brothers blew up the parade, somehow Boston had an army. It was really weird: they shut down the whole city for a day. And they had half-tracks and what looked like tanks. It didn't look like a police department that I ever saw. We are an increasingly militarized society, and because these budgets are getting bigger and bigger, they need to justify those budgets. So sometimes you need to find crime-- Local police budgets are not getting bigger; they're being shrunk. If you work at the local level, if you work with police chiefs, and the people want the services from the police. Yes, you got to make them better, but in Los Angeles-- But we didn’t want the police at Occupy Wall Street, I’ll tell you that. But you were not victims of crime. We were victims of brutality. There’s 125-page report that's put together by NYU law professors, documenting all the First Amendment violations conducted by the NYPD.
Spending every moment in the studio
I never said it'd be fair

Westcoast nigga, Quik and Snoop Dogg 
9-9 nigga When I wake up in the morning and I get up out my bed

Cause we're all a little strong
In the Beach, where the paper's long
But as for me
I only G when I'm buss'n rocks
Dogg Pound
 Verse One:
Nigga, you know you gotta have heart
I told you niggas from the start
If I'm still in it, I'm in it for life
Always stay down and keep my motha fuckin' game tight
Cause ever since Elementary, or was it Pre-school Quik?
I was a motha fuckin' fool
I had to have papers it was routine
A young nigga on a mission for them collard greens
I, shake niggas
Break Niggas
Make niggas, shank theyselves
For fuckin with my wealth 
And it'll catch on
Cause if it don't, it's on
And, cuzz, I ain't even slippin' when I'm all alone
Sittin' back loungin' in the Chronic Zone
Clown me ya gone
Surround me, it's on
Get the money you're gone
My niggas' paper so long

So if you want me, get me, got me

But now they call me Snoop Gotti

I'm blastin' at this nigga that was trippin'
O, knuckle head nigga, thought I was slippin'
But I wasn't slippin', I was on deck
I blast his ass, peck peck now his shirt's wet
Dead, gone, light's out
With no remorse, I had to take him out
I'm laughin' at this shit cause it was funny
Fuckin' with the dogg I take your life and your money
And then I dip to my spot 
And set up shop with yo rocks 
And nobody gon' speak on the 8-7
Cause still, all doggs go to heaven  Verse 3:
I'm freestylin'
C-stylin'
Snoop and Quik comin' through we fin' to take you to the island
Where the bitches and the bud come free
And everybody listen to the D-O double G
Hoes on my dick, niggas on my nuts
People be lovin' me because I drop cuts
That makes sense, it make big money
See Snoop is that nigga who don't hafta play funny
But I got yo honey, up under my wing
Cause she like the song that the bow-wow sing
I'll put her in a cling
I won't buy her a ring
But I'll put her on the ho-stroll to make me some green
And even if she never even saw me befo'

Coming back in a week, and the weak good
Riddance, only the strong permitted to ride
Or test drive with Kendrick the Jedi, one of a
Kind like great antiques museums buy
Haters I tell em hi, enemies I don't tell em shit

The rebirth of hip hop since they got abortions
And I rock like Mt. Rushmore, grab your thesaurus
So you can find a synonym of a nigga that been gem
Diamond in the rough
Sheriffs wanna see me cuffed like the links of a button up
Book em down! Fuck is up?
Mind of a Vietnam Vet when a nigga rhyme
A nigga shine, like I'm seeing signs in a different light
I'm on my grind, see it right? Real starving artist
Finna blow like a Mario Game cartridge, standing on my own two
Me and Dave like Big and Puff before shiny suits
Welcome to the Compton Zoo, lying with a lion on Rosecrans Avenue
A tiger on Central
Arms so soar beating up these instrumentals Sounwave give me
More, after that find a morgue with a mortice, because we.. Ooh, and I'm back up on my bullshit, shooting to the top with a hollow
Tip full clip
Analogy is like a pit bull on the pulpit, I drool I don't really
Spit, mad dog in this bitch, foaming at the mouth, is you a man or a mouse?
Sipping Mickey's, while you looking like Mickey trapping it out
That's not a diss, that's really a dope line, and in order to see my vision you
Probably would go blind
I'm chilling with a blonde, she dumb as fuck, but she can suck a bowling ball
Through a straw, that make you tell your mom
I'm just a little nigga trying to make my city proud, I used to watch Doug and wear
My cousins hand-me-downs
Now I'm grown up, unemployed, sipping Henny, pissing throuh a cup, and still get
The job done, 2DopeBoyz I said what up, tell your listeners to have some frost
Bitten gloves cause 
You refreshed, don't want no static
I stretch my blow like elastic, what you need tycoon?
Yaper or plastic, my back against the wall
Hubba rocks in my jaw, mouth full of spinach fetti
Fetch'n go-getters, hitters on my team on my squad
Ready to smash you niggas; ready to do our job
In the cut with them 16-year-olds that I recruit
Ready to bust a nigga shit, you better not hit dip or boot
I spit, nothin but the best of the sloop
The soil, the gutter, the unrecouped
I'm slick like this like I look 
I ain't gotta touch it no mo', even though I used to cook
The book of sugar, the tragic magic, the plastic, the habit

MAYYYYYYN

Serve birds and from the curb serve Kit-Kat
Split that, feel that, and then I hit that
Big back, whole bunches know I spent that
I'm a boss on location, vacation for the whole unit
Hundred grand let 'em know I'm doin it
Hundred man's what I'm crewin it
Put my foot with the ankle and the shoe in it
You can bust yo' guns but now I bust yo' lip
And that's Click spit so don't you trip 
We stay high and we move zips
And only cop Bents fully loaded when they come with the kits Bumpin your gums'll get your pumpkin put on display 
Off with his head he wasn't usin it anyway
I told him to park his tongue but he kept on jaw-jackin and shit
Pillowtalkin and motormouthin and tryin to impress that bitch
Thinkin he bulletproof, just drunk a fifth of courage juice
Outside of the party loose, with a empty bottle of Grey Goose
Mad dog'n and talkin loud, feelin his Wheaties and oats 
Comin at a player sideways in front of my cutthroats
I said, This nigga just high, give that nigga a pass
Don't take that nigga life, but he kept on talkin trash
I walked away and laughed  but he knew he had it comin
That lil' nigga startin bustin, this lil' nigga started runnin
Rrrrrrrrah, rrrrrrrrah, left his ass leakin

I'm swingin' when I'm off the ecstasy 
That's a Molly park, yeah
Iron on me, hoo-hoo
That's a Tony Stark, yeah
Pourin' fours in a twenty ounce soda pop, yeah
I'm O.C
Three-gram wood full of OG 
Give BM dick like Moby 
Gun make him flash, Adobe 
Pay up that cash, you owe me, yeah, huh
Bitch, I need it
Matter fact, fuck that shit, I'm rich 
You can keep it
Yeah , damn
Rich niggas over here , yeah
Broke niggas over there 
Why is you over here? 
Go over there 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah I'm in town 
Party's goin' down 
Shoot 'em down 
With a .50 round 
Run the town 
Ballin' hard, you outta bounds 
So much money, damn it
I forgot the count 
Ayy, look at my bank account 
Look at the cash amount 
I get the cash, I'm out 
I do the dash, I'm out 
Look at my bank account 
Look at the cash amount 
I get the cash, I'm out 
I just be cashin' out 
Yeah Guru
Let's have a little fun with this one
I got another one
Nigga your shit is trash
When I see you I'mma beat your ass
You better stop playing with me
I don't give a fuck about no magazine
Don't need radio to do my thing
You see me nigga: bling, bling, bling
Take it to the bridge Your SoundScan going down
You better off selling them now
Out the trunk, trunk trunk
You better stop fucking around
You're gon' make me chase your coward ass down
With the pump, pump, pump I came into this game
Wanting more paper than Puff
Now I realise Puff paper ain't enough
Last week Bleek puffed Puff paper up
And Beans buy a Bentley every week
And I know y'all don't know but G4's ain't cheap
And B she got ride G3, nothing less
Plus real estate in Miami is highway robbery
Wars cost, I need guns for my robberies
I'm buying tanks, if you're thinking it's just rap
Don't go too far on that verse
Get your whole chest collapsed
It's just the facts
God bless the cats that think I'm a liar
Pick up a paper nigga, read my priors
Just retire!
They screaming from the peanut gallery
Not til my salary's like the real Mike Lowry
I kill shit 'til I catch Will Smith
Then I'm running Spielberg down 
Everything I say I do, you can feel my words now
Or read about 'em later, nigga
You don't even know me and you mad
How's it feel to be a hater?
Now I know exactly how it feels to be a Laker
I'm in power in a Maybach with the missing towers
With a keyless ignition, eating Chows
A Nobu nigga, merci beaucoup
I'm in France, I meant Japan
What the fuck wrong with you?
Everybody wanna know my networth
Niggas wake up on my dick—eat some breakfast first
I'm a legend, I ain't even left this Earth
I'm considered one of the best 'cause I wreck shit the worst
I don't care about no vest, when that TEC hit it hurts
Spinning that Lexus in reverse
Making your next whip a hearse
Best to keep it in the verse
If it leaks into the street, I won't sleep
I'ma creep, 'til I rest one of your peeps
And I promise on my Momma, I'm just trying to keep the peace
But I'm an outcast, nigga
So I gotta keep a piece
So when it cock you and shock you, it's a security breach
Don't make me reach point break
I hit you, Point Blank

Kiss who you wanna kiss, hug who you wanna hug
?, white, black
Fat, tall, small
Opposite the tracks, whatever it's on ya'll

With no bait on my hook, tryna catch a fish
Tryna have meals, four course
Got hella ideals, but no resources
Don't let them knock your motivation, keep tryin'
Your probably just ahead of yo time
Like me, they told me I'd never progress and
Be-become what I am today, them niggas dead wrong  x2
You gotta be original
Just be you

Take a chance and show the world you
Just be you We Gonna Hop In The Ride And Let The Rims Roll
Gotta Hundred Pair Of Nikes No Timbos

So Many People Wanna Look Alike
And Act The Same, But What's The Price
When You Got No Game, They Won't Let You Play
Your Too Stingy, You Shouldn't Act That Way
Cause Your Goin Have To Pay, If You Don't Speak Your Mind

My girl a superstar all from a home movie
Bow on our arrival, the un-American idols
What niggas did in Paris, got 'em hangin' off the Eiffel
Yeah, I'm talkin' business, we talkin' CIA
I'm talkin' George Tenet, I seen him the other day
He asked me about my Maybach, think he had the same
Except mine tinted and his might have been rented
You know, white people get money, don't spend it
Or maybe they get money, buy a business
I rather buy 80 gold chains and go ign'ant
I know Spike Lee gon' kill me, but let me finish
Blame it on the pigment, we livin' no limits
Them gold Master P ceilings was just a figment
Of our imagination, MTV cribs
Now I'm lookin' at a crib right next to where TC lives
That's Tom Cruise, whatever she accuse
He wasn't really drunk, he just had a frew brews
Pass the refreshments, a cool, cool beverage
Everything I do need a news crew's presence
Speedboat swerve, homie, watch out for the waves
I'm way too black to burn from sunrays
So I just meditate at the home in Pompeii
About how I could build a new Rome in one day
Every time I'm in Vegas they screamin' like he's Elvis
But I just wanna design hotels and nail it
Shit is real, got me feelin' Israelian
Like Bar Refaeli, or Gisele—no, that's Brazilian
Went through, deep depression when my mama passed
Suicide, what kinda talk is that?
But I been talkin' to God for so long
That if you look at my life I guess he's talkin' back
Fuckin' with my clique Ain't nobody fresher than my muh'fuckin' clique
As I look around, they don't do it like my clique
And all these bad bitches, man
They want the, they want the, they want the
Go!
I want y'all to see this like film
C-Sick on production, Nas on the vocal.. let's go Lots of fog at night, red brake lights
The freeway beside a restaurant
Cold egg whites sat on my plate like
3 AM, this is a spot frequented by some made men
I'm high on hemp
A fly old pimp just walked in, his suit was shark skin
He woke me up from some of the thoughts I'm lost in
What fame does to niggas, change love to bitterness
Friends to fiends for the audience screams, ridiculous
Jumped up, paid my tab, got in my Benz and went
To my old housing tenement, visit my old friends
Some show love and some are envious
Some got the heart of gold, some venomous
At times I wanna go back to being penniless
Ignorance is bliss, I love being innocent
Ugh, but life's got me on the fence again
And all is real so all's worth mentioning If I could press pause, or fast forward past the hardness
Visions written bring words to life like I'm smitten with
Memories real, still ill, now I appear crisp like film Ice on gold from mossbergs to golf clubs
Ninth hole, the white rose, the life I chose
Bandanna over the eye, Dior sandals
Car doors rise with no touch of the handles
Capiche? Caprese salad’s on beaches and islands
Far from police sirens at least for a weekend
Then it's back to the streets creepin
I'd like to make a free toast of champagne on behalf of this nigga speaking
Add a splash to the Seagrams
Roll the hash for my world renowned goons this evening
As I circle the table like Babe Ruth
Louisville Slugger in my grip for a fake dude
Bat to the brain with brute force
Splatter my cream velour suit
They hit me with lawsuit
I slip in your whore coupe
Your bitch hate you, word to Jesus
Bet you never knew she toot yay and play with a gay crew
OGs hate to make way for the new
Young niggas want Polo ain't fucking with J Crew
It's safe to say I was once young and innocent
But look what I know now, is all worth mentioning I speak to the street life
The executive chief types
The felons, young mothers with kids they trying to feed right
The botega wearers modern day Che Guevaras
Cuz I barely survived crazy eras
Honest, always make good on my promise
I don't talk it I do it you can hold me to it
I was born to this life I didn't invent it
But I'd be wrong not to take a few meal tickets
You and I are real different, we don't share the same beliefs
Fight in the ring or buy ringside seats
Either you like beef, or you like to spectate
Give me gloves, and I'mma do it how the refs say
We touch em and we come out tussling
The ghetto is my garden of eden
So I keep bobbin' and weavin'
It's intense so I'm hardly breathing
KO, and the winner is Nas, that's how the scene ends Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
Lick on these nuts and suck the dick
Get's the fuck out after you're done
And I hops in my ride to make a quick run
Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
Lick on these nuts and suck the dick
Get's the fuck out after you're done
And I hops in my ride to make a quick run
I used to know a bitch named Eric Wright
We used to roll around and fuck the hoes at night
Tight than a motherfucker with the gangsta beats
And we was ballin' on the motherfuckin' Compton streets
Peep, the shit got deep and it was on
Number 1 song after number 1 song
Long as my motherfuckin' pockets was fat
I didn't give a fuck where the bitch was at
But she was hangin' with a white bitch doin' the shit she do
Suckin' on his dick just to get a buck or 2
And the few ends she got didn't mean nothin'
Now she's suing cause the shit she be doin' ain't shit
Bitch can't hang with the streets, she found herself short
So now she's takin' me to court
It's real conversation for your ass
So recognize and pass to Daz
Now as I'm rollin' with my nigga Dre and Eastwood
Fuckin' hoes, clockin' dough up to no good
We flip flop and serve hoes like flap jacks
 Bitch, and it's like that
This is what you look for in a ho who got cash flow
Ya run up in them hoes and grab the cash
And get your dash on
While you're chillin', with your homies and shit
And how my niggas kick the anthem like this, bitch!
Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
Lick on these nuts and suck the dick
Get's the fuck out after you're done
And I hops in my ride to make a quick run
To the store, to get me a 4-0
Snoop Doggy Dogg paged, that must mean more hoes
So I head down the street to Long Beach
Just so I could meet, a freak
To lick me from my head to my feet
And I'm here, now I'm ready to be done up
Nothin' but homies around so I puts my gun up
Bitches on my nuts like clothes
But I'm from the pound and we don't love them hoes
How could you trust a hoe? 
'Cause a hoe's a trick
I don't love them tricks 
'Cause a trick's a bitch
And my dick's constantly in her mouth
And turnin' them trick ass hoes the fuck out, now
I once had a bitch named Mandy May
Used to be up in them guts like everyday
The pussy was the bomb, had a nigga on sprung
I was in love like a motherfucker lickin' the pearl tongue
The homies used to tell me that she wasn't no good
But I'm the maniac in black, Mr. Snoop Eastwood
So I figure niggas wouldn't trip with mine
Guess what? Got gaffled by one time
I'm back to the motherfucking county jail
6 months on my chest, now it's time to bail
I get's released on a hot sunny day
My nigga D.O.C. and my homey Dr Dre
Scooped in a coupe, Snoop we got news
Your girl was trickin' while you was draped in your county blues
I ain't been out a second
And already gotta do some motherfucking chin checking
Move up the block as we groove up the block
See my girl's house, Dre, pass the Glock
Kick in the do', I look on the flo'
It's my little cousin Daz and he's fuckin' my hoe, yo 
I uncocked my shit, I'm heart-broke but I'm still loc'ed
Man, fuck a bitch!
Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
Lick on these nuts and suck the dick
Get's the fuck out after you're done
And I hops in my ride to make a quick run
Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
Lick on these nuts and suck the dick
Get's the fuck out after you're done
And I hops in my ride to make a quick run
 I don't give a fuck about a bitch
But I and her know that they can't fade this
'Cause I'm doing my own thing down with the swing
I'm hangin' with Death Row like it ain't no thing
I say you know can't deal
'Cause I'm a bitch that's real
Motherfucker need to step back, hell yeah
They need to chill
Because I don't give a fuck
And I don't give a fuck
And I don't give a fuck
I don't give a fuck
And now I gotta do some
I gotta do some shit that's clean
But when I'm on a dick, hell yeah, I get real mean
Like a washing machine
I can wash the clothes
All the hoes knows
That I'm on the flow ho
But they can't hang with my type og swing
I ain't tryin' to say I suck every ding-a-lang
But just the juicy ones
With he tip of the tongue
And then their sprung
With the nuts hung
Bitches ain't shit

Walked in Onyx, seen asses flying
She told me that her number was classified
I said bitch, you should ask for mine!
Sippin' margaritas in Miami with my mamacita
All-Star Game, she was in the bleachers
Every time I see her, I say nice to meet ya
Had it in the room girl, underneath her Met her at Live on Sunday
She was in Atlanta on Monday
Club going up on a Tuesday
Told her she can get it how she want it
I ain't picky, I ain't got a type
I'm single, I ain't got a wife
But if I hit you with the slow-stroke
I bet that you gonna spend the night
I bet you find another flight because she just wanna love the life
Seen her out in Cali, man in Vegas she was at the fight
Sunday at the rehab, beat the pussy made her relapse 
Ain't I
I'm a... I'm a... I'm a
I'm a hustler's hustler
A gangster's gangster
I'm a rapper's rapper
Your favorite, ain't I
Ain't I, ain't I, ain't I I'm still winning and I'm nowhere near finished
It's just the first inning
And I'm gunning for the Pennant
And I been this, God made me
Y'all hate me, y'all atheists
Y'all safety is at risk
It's the return of the Messiah
One and only Hov
No I ain't God but I've been made in his mould
So when the story is told let it be said I refuse to fold
I only fold bread
I stood for the best, I owed no debt
I represent the hood til my dying breath
I took a pay cut to become an exec
So the next motherfucker can earn his paycheck
And even though these niggas talk greasy bout me
Ask these niggas how they 'gon eat without me
Ask these niggas if they want stats involved
And even if they don't like me, they respect the God I'm hustler's poster child, I'm supposed to style
I ain't got nothing to prove, I'm supposed to smile
I ain't insecure, I'm vested in a piece of Carol's Daughter
I'm in Sephora
Bricks are insignificant to him
He's a grown man, you're an infant to him
Take your baby money and burn, T-Ha
I spent that on furniture
I got Warhols on my hall's wall
I got Basquiats in the lobby of my spot
I'm so sophisticatedly hood, S. Carter cashmere premium goods
Thousand dollars for the sneaks
Timbo on the track, 250 for the beat
G4 back and forth to my floor seats
I spent a couple mil' just to lose to the Heat Anything you aspire, to acquire I got
Any gun you say, you fired
I shot Any type of paraphernalia, I am the seller
I guess you're saying that's how I started Roc-A-Fella
Feds all fed up
DEA can't tell the dirty money from a Rocawear sweater And I'm never, ever going back, back
Oh never that, oh never that Whoever rap, you be doing that for practice, nigga
I'm in the twelve-step program
I ain't touched drugs in so long I'm a sober man
I'm clean as a whistle, official
Got a way, I'm the King of all kings, it's official
I'm a hustler's hustler
A gangster's gangster
I'm a rapper's rapper
Your favorite, ain't I
Ain't I, ain't I, ain't I
I spit it
I spit it so you could feel it
You know what I'm saying
I'm saying I put my personality into it These hoes is all the same
They all want a nigga hollering out money ain't a thing
'Bout pathetic as a player that lost his game
How a motherfuckin' hoe turn a pimp to a lame
See these sheets is like the street you gotta stay strapped up
Cause that's how these hoes'll get you wrapped up
Calling you later saying what she crying about
Put that bitch on now what she lying about
Talking about how she late and how she eat a lot
See she eat a lot cause she smoke weed a lot
Why all the bogus hoes want to front on k
Why the fine hoes can't have one on the way
I prolly tell her to keep it, it'll be our little secret
Boniquan now my shorty looking fine: Puerto Rican
As long as she don't flip it tell her man that we creepin'
What we doin' is all day
When I hang up it ain't called hate its called wait
When you get popped don't call me call Clay
That's your man ain't it
That's the plan ain't it
When she told me it was mine I damn near fainted Let em put you on peep it though
I ain't even want to freak the hoe
Shit I just snapped the first time 'bout a week ago
Let em put you on peep it though
I ain't even want to freak the hoe
I just snapped the first time 'bout a week ago Now these hoes run gun I ain't finna say nothing
She tried to pop my pockets before I even got paid
Don't trip, this bitch was a whip
You could learn something from her but you might get burned from her
We smoked a couple of dimes I hit it a couple of times
Now she say she pregnant and its mine
I'm thinking she was lying by the looks on her face
But she started paging me like every single day
She said her man going away the judge gave him three
Must've thought she was gon' make a fool out of me
To bail this nigga out all she need was a G
Now she must've came to me so I had to change the beat
I said look hoe you must be crazy off that dope
That's when I snatched the rope then I kicked her on the floor
And all that shit I bought you bitch I want it back

I ain't even want to freak the hoe
I just snapped the first time 'bout a week ago

Gave hoes abortion loot they bought shoes with it
Say they pregnant who's is it
Tell 'em you did it
Forcing these niggas out of abortion cheese
Paid a couple of hundred now or later more than G's
 have a kid by a lame ass broad
I knocked up this girl I barely liked cause she bugged me
She ain't even cute, our baby prolly by ugly
And I ain't happen to have that baby and your stomach doing 
How much it cost to get rid of it? I give you half of that
But I didn't know that she was on the pill
Needed the money for her hair and her nails
And her cell phone bill

I just snapped the first time 'bout a week ago Let em put you on peep it though
I ain't even want to freak the hoe
Shit I just snapped the first time 'bout a week ago
Is it wickedness?
Is it weakness?
You decide
Are we gonna live or die? So I was takin' a walk the other day
And I seen a woman—a blind woman
Pacin' up and down the sidewalk
She seemed to be a bit frustrated
As if she had dropped somethin' and
Havin' a hard time findin' it
So after watchin' her struggle for a while
I decide to go over and lend a helping hand, you know?
Hello ma'am, can I be of any assistance?
It seems to me that you have lost something
I would like to help you find it.
She replied: Oh yes, you have lost something
You've lost… your life. {Gunshot} Is it wickedness? Lamar stated his views on police brutality
With that line in the song, quote:
And we hate the popo, wanna kill us in the street fo' sho'.
Oh please, ugh, I don't like it

Purps On The Beat

Me no want no drama
Not a fighter, a lover
Do you hear me calling?
Do you hear me calling?
Me no want no drama
I just want you, my darling Break away and make a way to make it
Love the way you lookin' when you naked
Treat your heart just like a blunt of OG
Roll it up, I kissed it and I smoke it
Gots to be joking
Where in the fuck did you think you were going?
Foldin' and packin' your clothes like you ain't know I was gon' unfold it
Wine glass full of your emotions
Oh, Pinot Grigio, sippin', beautiful, heaven-soul woman
Me don't know, let me know, let me
In your heart, don't you dare forget me
I'm your fan, your posters on my walls inside my head, yeah, yeah
I'm your fan, your posters on my walls inside my head, yeah Do you hear me calling?

Not a fighter, a lover
Do you hear me calling?
Do you hear me calling?
Me no want no drama
I just want you, my darling You drive me insane, no girl make me feel this way
Wait girl, you got your ways, girl you are my getaway
Wait, let me keep you safe
In exchange, give me brain, brain
You my main thing, turn around, bang bang
Hit the beach in LA like you a beach ball
Me and you in the Lambo truck, you start it up and skrrt off
We park after dark at the park by the mansion, take your skirt off
Oh, me can't wait to get all up inside of it
My heart is racing, every time I'm tastin' it
Wait until the drugs fade out
Hate making love when I'm faded
That's because I wanna feel it
Girl, you give me the best feelin'
Yes, girl you're the best, take away stress, love me to death
Even when I'm a mess Do you hear me calling?

I just want you, my darling  Ring, do you hear me calling?
Me no want no drama
Ring, do you hear me calling?
Me no want no drama
I know all of y'all hear me, none of y'all scare me
Cause niggas die daily
Coming out with my guns real early
Laying in your stairway, cause niggas die daily
So I got niggas around you
Mad like they're back for their man
You've killed just a year ago today
So call it a death anniversary
Rushing to emergency, niggas die daily What if I told you that AZ didn't exist
And I put him there, played it like a ventriloquist
Cause niggas spit fake shit and y'all respect it
I spit that real shit and y'all won't buy the record
What if me and the rapper homey was really cool
And we used that whole thing as a media tool
Would you say I was a sucka or say I was savvy
If I told you mothafucka's that me and K wasn't married?
What if Jungle wrote my shit and I'm really illiterate
And the whole Nas catalog was just an experiment
What if I really died when Ill Will got shot
This is Will rhyming right now while Nas is chilling with 'Pac
What If I did all the advertisements thrown my way
And I've boned every chick that would throw me some play
I'd have to load another AK cause niggas be jealous
Cause we real like them Brazil favelas Scream at the nigga breathe don't breathe your last breath
But you know a nigga dead when he pee on himself
Blatter giving up on 'em, face start to puff on 'em
Bloating up, nigga cold as fuck, trying hold on 'em
Loosen up the nine out of his fingers
Angels coming only he can hear the psalms that they're singing
And it hurts me, the planets cursed, B
This your niggas first year anniversary
This how it goes down in every ghetto
So it's quite natural for rappers to settle
And make pop music, nursery hooks
Cause back then we thought the only thing that worked was the jooks
They're tryna pimp a game that done pimped them first
I'm pimping the industry so they acknowledge our worth
The next anniversary we all unite
Let's all get together or we're loosing the fight Gimme that '94 Puff shit, Ali
I'm so appalled, Louis Vuitton draws
The shit, a booth for me is a bathroom stall
If you're not fond of me, you're comedy, Little Duval
I have a lot of flaws, I'm human before all
I wake up in the morning smell some coffee, then tell your bitch to get off me
Mos Def, word to every autopsy
Man that boy bad, man that boy spaz
'Til he crash like Sandra Bullock and Luda on the ave
He changed his name, he a conscious rapper
Naw mutha'fucka I'm just Compton's rapper
I might spit some intricate shit for retards not to get
But really I'm just as rude as Marshall Mathers
Is that a contradiction? He contradicting himself again?
Of course that's a contradiction, the fuck you think life is?
We not like like Christ is
We all want ices and devices to make the bitches say I like this
People don't understand why I went southpaw
I looked in the mirror and said I can't be like y'all
I can't be like Game, I can't be like Eazy
To get in this rap game, I know it won't be easy
Cause my shit different
I know
He from Compton, where he from, have he killed before?
Truth is, I ain't the most ruthless, but I'm not cupid
Before she had two kids my momma worked two gigs
To get out Chicago
To move right back to another ghetto, on Sante Fe playing the lotto
I used to want a champagne two door Tahoe
Until I seen that same truck shot by five-o
Dead with his eyes closed, y'all should've seen him
Off a gallon of cough syrup, but rifles had leaned him
That's why these tough rappers man I don't believe 'em
Y'all wanna be 'em, I wanna grab bats and beat 'em
So they can feel the pain of the blocks I'm from
Where my heart turned numb
And the powder and the shells come up off that gun
Come up off your chain, or come up off your life and have a fatherless son
It's the syllabus for the ignorant militant mind
'quivalent crimes for jail sentencin'
No one preventin' this war
You sure, you sure
Sure as the edges on every ocean, now let's explore
The Kendrick Lamar LP I been promotin' for 'bout a month
Don't worry its comin' soon, like a fast nut
I never be gassed up, some labels they passed up
Now the industry crashin', I guess they got bad luck
Your bad, you don't write neither? There goes another fad
Shit I write ether
I get it in like the Vanna on Wheel of Fortune forcin' your forfeit
With the strength of the prime forces of four fork lifts
This is very extra necessary
This extra scary, this is Amityville
This the Exorcist on ecstasy pills
And if I can't do it my integrity will
Head dog wishes, every Compton bitch is
I mean this shit is
Fucking ridiculous
Fucking ridiculous
They all got a fat ass but lower case titties
Now I gotta mix and match, jungle fever, white and black
Double D, Brittney, Becky get your mouth intact
Reg call 'em Jabberjaw, she gon' hop skip and jog
Just to read my twitter blog
Man these hoes pitiful
And to you bloggers that say I'm weak
You know how long I took to chop this fuckin' beat?
Y'all don't 'preciate shit
All y'all do is hate shit
And if I don't say shit y'all still say I ain't shit
And that's ridiculous
I mean that shit is
Fucking ridiculous
One time
Reporting live
Compton, California Have you ever felt like, like you never get life?
Like you never did right, sort of like a black sheep?
Back down, backing out your dreams like some bad sleep
Chasing for the wind but you never win the track meet
Oh, what a cold world for a broke nigga, it's bitter
And life's a bitch, don't hit women, so I bit her
I struck enough pain let her know I wasn't playing
I was so sincere like Nas first name, in Belly
They tell me, it's very difficult to see 25
And if I survive it's probably with a celly
My opportunities are low because my brown complexion floats
In the ghetto rather in some heels like Giuseppe's
They want me unemployed, until I hit the streets
Fulfilling voids of broke D-Boys selling weed
Fucking up my prestige, 'til I live with the blues
BB King or the neighbors of Snoop, that's why I'm In the club like fuck it, though
They say it's only one life, life, life
And if you say I can't live comfortable
I'ma tell you that's a lie, lie, lie
So while I hold this bottle of Ciroc with a hand full of ass
Celebrate the very day that I get past
Through the barbed wire
We are, we are 
We are, we are 
Through the, through barbed 
We will, will break 
So while I hold this bottle of Ciroc with a hand full of ass
Celebrate the very day that I get past
Through the barbed wire Have you ever felt like, like you never get life?
Like you never did right, sort of like a black sheep?
Tryna get away from the world's stereotype
Barbed wire got a barricade on your destiny, she desperately
In need of some inspiration, see what the people saying
She gon have a baby then flee from her education
At the age of 16, credit card scam schemes
See a scar on her eye, boyfriend brutality
She'll never get by, no how, no way
Welfare recipient, property of the state
Housing, Section 8, corner store prostitute
The owner bout to prosecute, the niggas tell her that she's cute
Hoodrat trashy, six baby daddies
And this baby daddy is new to the family
Chilling in pajamis, waiting on the first
Fast forward spilling drinks on her fur, that's why she In the club like fuck it, though
They say it's only one life, life, life
And if you say she can't live comfortable
She gon' tell you that's a lie, lie, lie
So while she up in VIP pouring Merlot in the glass
Celebrate the very day that she get past
Through the barbed wire
We are, we are 
We are, we are 
Through the, through barbed 
We will, will break 
So while she up in VIP pouring Merlot in the glass
Celebrate the very day that she get past
Through the barbed wire Have you ever felt like, you finally got life
You finally got right? No longer a black sheep
Living off ya dreams like Christina uh-Milian
In the front seat of a convertible eloping to get married
What a feeling of overcoming the odds
It's like we just hit the lottery, my God
There must be a God, cause golly
You done made it through the fight while squabbling Ali
Now ya lifestyle's looking up and you escaped the crooked cuffs
And you ain't have to kill a nigga just to make a couple bucks
And she ain't have to go and fuck on everybody for a dollar
Making good decisions, got a independent business-mind
And both of y’all are steady grindin', doing it the legal way
Just tryna make a decent pay on every second of the day
But they won't give you the credit, disses out they mouth
You must have joined the Illuminati just to ball out In the club like fuck it, though
They say it's only one life, life, life
And if you say I can't live comfortable
I'ma tell you that's a lie, lie, lie
So even if you overcame doubt and ya living ain't bad
Know it's a barbed wire that's always in your path
Through the barbed wire 
Then everybody say...
'Cause I won't get caught again
And I'm here to stop the trends
You can catch me if you try
Disappear into the night
And I'm gone So you made it past all the barbed wires?
There's one more left *Gunshot*They dug me out the soil in the Mines of the Motherland
Now I'm misplaced, one hand to another hand
Illegal smugglin', people strugglin'
Wish they could just throw me back in the mud again
Yeah, guess that's how we got here
Slave Trade then the Diamond Trade
Every child's afraid
When his Mother and Father get sprayed
Forced in the Army, young killer Brigade
Gets a new name and then he give his nose glue
Til' his mind can't take what he's gon' through
Lookin' in that dirt for that ice so blue
Then The Royal Family, the ice goes to
And this thing has to change, feelin' half-ashamed
As I rap with my Platinum chain
When you shop for a gift for me
You think about the misery?
The same way we made Apartheid History
We can do the same thing to the conflict ice
But everybody wanna shine, right? Everybody wants Heaven but nobody wants dead
Everybody wants Diamonds without the Bloodshed
Everybody wants Heaven but nobody wants dead
Everybody wants Diamonds without the Bloodshed
They wanna Shine on 'em
Shine on 'em X 7 My VVS glimmers on my chest
200-thou-encrusted watch on my wrist
I wonder how people starve to death
When God bless the land that lacks the harvest
The stone's equality, but they homes are poverty
And the whole world ignores the robbery
Bought my girl pretty rocks when she's mad at me
Tear-drop shaped, uh, perfect Clarity
It shocks, so many are killed annually
'Cause of greed, lust, and pure Vanity
Stop talkin' and do somethin' about it
Every Holiday Season, Jewelry stores crowded
Kids snatched from their homes, Mutilated alive
Husbands separated from wives, keep a Jesus piece to be fly
But back in the day there was a time when they called us shine Everybody wants Heaven but nobody wants dead
Everybody wants Diamonds without the Bloodshed
Everybody wants Heaven but nobody wants dead
Everybody wants Diamonds without the Bloodshed
They wanna shine on 'em
Shine on 'em X 7
Ten little Crip niggas runnin outside
All from the turf and they bangin out lives
Far from a scrub cuzz from the Eastside
Where they don't die they just multiply
So.. don't give them niggas a reason
To turn it into spray season
Don't give them niggas a reason
Because they'll turn it into Crip season The gangsta's back, the bank is fat
The gangsta MAC, in a gangsta 'llac
Hmm.. fools be like, Break off some cheese
Friends and enemies, aww nigga please
Fuck, you thought who pumped you up
Stop, you stuck too much, pop, drop, you plucked
It's all similar to gettin laaaid
On ya back when the motherfuckin K spraaays
I grind for my shine about my bidness
Lunatic on the shit and I get ignit 
Gonna proceed to squeeze with ease
One of these, they can't believe how I leave 'em
Look into a mind of a nigga that's crazy
Seventeen years old and still a baby
Gangstas real, they pop the pill
You cap back, young motherfucker it's like that Wake up in the morning lookin funny and shit
Fuck a honey dip.. cause I got money to get
Ain't no books, ain't no help, ain't no role to this
Stay focused young homey, that's the code to this
Keep a strap in ya pocket when you trip through the towns
There's a million motherfuckers tryna get you down
A lot of pain in this game, cocaine is the thang
If ya money right then you might get you a chain
But if ya money is low, there's only one way to go
Jack a rapper at a local rap radio show
So mean, so green, crip back to the block
Then brag to the homies, show 'em what you got
It's a gangsta jack 
And they thought we just gangsta rapped
Yeah nigga, we take your snaps
Your shooby dooby, hooroobies, and your Scooby snacks 
It's like that! It's a whole lot of fillin when you on the Eastside
On the Eastside, nigga we ride

I can't walk down the street without my gun, gunPart 1: Blue's Freestyle Everything, everything this my only single thing
Everything I hear is my answer
And if you think I say, then innocent if I say?
I never hear that, I be in the posse
Never seen a ceiling in my whole life
Everything I seen, everything is rotten
Never sit in silence, innocent is Carter
Innocent we seek them
I and say we see them
Everything I feed, everything I read
Boom shakalaka, boom shakalaka
Boom shakalaka, boom shakalaka
Everything in shaka, everything in faka
Everything in shaka, everything in faka Part 2: We Family I got bloodlines in Benin, that explains the voodoo
Got poison in my pen, thank god for Lulu
And thank the heavens for BB, her Creole roots run deeply
I'm crazy, you ever leave me I might have to put on a gris-gris
Spell for us to stay together
Facelessness
Maison Margiela embracing 'Cause we family
We, we, we, family 'Cause more than ever we gon' have to stick together, feel me?
More than ever my niggas gon' have to stick together, feel me?
Already ahead of your end, in the foreign bumping Fela, feel me?
Was out in Havana when that had that banned forever, feel me?
Fuck embargoes, I'm a narco
Colombian ties, shout out to Dapo
OG Juan also 'Cause we family
We, we, we, family Feel me?
All the fellas from the favelas 'round me, feel me?
Lagos, all the barrios 'round me, feel me?
Bismillah, all the gods around me
Mexicanos ain't building fucking walls around me 'Cause we family

I'm out in the art clubs in London sipping tea, feel me?
I'm out in Michelangelos in FTs 'Cause we family
We, we, we, family, feel me? Stadium status My big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
Used to be Dame and Biggs' brother
Who was Hip Hop brother, who was No I.D. friend
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin It's the Hard Knock Life Tour, sellout
Picture us in the mall, coppin' Iceberg and yell out Jigga
Yeah, that's what we'll yell out, yell out
You know the name do I gotta spell out or tell 'bout
J-A-Y, and 'Ye so shy
Now he won't even step to his idol to say hi
Standing there like a mime and let the chance pass by
Back of my mind, He could change your life
With all these beats I did, at least let him hear it
At least you can brag to ya friends back at the gig
But he got me out me out my momma crib
Then he help me get my momma a crib Big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
Used to be Dame and Biggs' brother
Who was Hip Hop brother, who was No I.D. friend
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin, begin
Let the story begin
If you feel the way I feel why don't you wave your hands? Fresh off the plane, I'm off to Baseline
Nothing handed out, I'm 'bout to take mine
'round the same time of that Blueprint 1
And these beats in my pocket was that blueprint for him
I'd play my little songs in that old back room
He'd bob his head and say Damn! Oh, that's you?
But by The Black Album, I was blacking out
Partyin' S.O.B.'s and we had packed a crowd
Big brother got his show up at Madison Square
And I'm like Yeah, yeah, we gon' be there but
Not only did I not get a chance to spit it
Carline told me I could buy two tickets
I guess big brother was thinkin' a little different
And kept little brother at bay, at a distance
But everything that I felt was more bogus
Only made me more focused, only wrote more potent
Only thing I wanna know is why I get looked over
I guess I'll understand when I get more older
Big brother saw me at the bottom of the totem
Now I'm on the top and everybody on the scrotum My big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
Used to be Dame and Biggs' brother
Who was Hip Hop brother, who was No I.D. friend
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin, begin
Let the story begin
If you feel the way I feel why don't you wave your hands? Have you ever walked in the shadow of a giant?
Not only a client, the Presidito, hola, Hovito
The game gettin' foul so here's a free throw
I was always on the other side of the peephole
Then I dropped Jesus Walks now I'm on the steeple
And we know, New Jack City got to keep my brother
But to be number one I'mma beat my brother
On that Diamonds remix I swore I spazzed
Then my big brother came through and kicked my ass
Sibling rivalry, only I could see
It was the pride in me that was drivin' me
At the Grammys I said, I inspired me
But my big brother who I always tried to be
When I kicked a flow it like pick-and-roll
Cause even if he gave me the rock, it's give-and-go
I guess Beanie's style was more of a slam dunk
But my shit was more like a finger roll
But I had them singles though
And them hoes at the show gonna mingle, yo, heh, y'all know
I told Jay I did a song with Coldplay
Next thing I know he got a song with Coldplay
Back in my mind I'm like, Damn, no way
Translate, español: No way, José
Then I went and told Jay Brown
Shoulda known that was gonna come back around
Shoulda talked to you like a man, shoulda told you first
But I told somebody else and that's what made shit worse My big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
So here's a few words from ya kid brother
If you admire somebody you should go on 'head tell 'em
People never get the flowers while they can still smell 'em
A idol in my eyes, god of the game
Heart of the City, Roc-a-Fella chain
Never be the same, never be another
Number one, Young Hov, also my big brother My big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
Used to be Dame and Biggs' brother
Who was Hip Hop brother, who was No I.D. friend
No I.D., my mentor, and that's where the story ends Toomp killed this shitYeah, its drizzy baby
Ah Ha uhh I’m ready, alright J fresh I got 'em Look, I’m really the heir to the fortune of a millionaire
Talking money with me is really unfair
At the border like, I swear, I have nothing to declare
I am nothing like these other niggas coming out this year
Even if you never met me you can tell I’m on the same shit
Loyal as a mother fucker nobody be saying shit
Dope boys know me cause I often speak they language
So well spoken man I should have went to Cambridge
Y-o-u-n-g ho, women they can be so
Motivated by money that’s why they be on me for
Ask your favorite rapper homie guarantee that he know
If he is the one I’m the zero, 
Please comprehend I am a Surf Club general
I’m Mr. consistent I have never come in intervals
You don’t want be caught in the middle like a center fold
I'm committing suicide if we're ever identical
Click clack pow how you like a nigga now?
In control of my domain
They can do what I allow
And I know Toronto miss me I'mma be home in a minute
That's my city and I run it you just run around in it
They see me out in person and say I ain't heard you sing yet
The world is my playground dont fuck with my swingset
We get the pitching then that's when it gets to piling
I'm calling your bluff don’t act like you can’t see me dialing
I'm in, low cut Louis with them hard denim jeans an a beige jacket
Hands down the best in my age bracket
Holla at meHe's a kaleidoscope to look in; a black men and white women
Sometimes together make exotic looking children
But mixed race kids become fixated on separating themselves from the hatred
Your grandma on the black side make you slam the station
Your grandma on the white side was educated in schools that were segregated; maybe she was racist
Maybe you can't, today, school her on some brand new today shit
If I grew up a rich boy, like this boy, this white boy, like you boy, the Christmas toys, the privileged joys
I think I'd be less stressed, the whole family at home, the ideal address
But he's dealing with self mutilation, dungeons and dragons, Ouija boards, rituals with satan
Yeah, we grew up with similar anger
Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Aye, aye
Who am I? Bitch, who are you?

Yeah, niggas want to talk about this rap shit
Niggas want to talk about this money
About these cars, these homes, these labels
Clothes, sneakers, big money shit
Now everybody trying to get rich
Now get rich niggas, fuck it Some rap pioneers be them crackheads
When they speak, you see missin' teeth
Silver chain with a silver piece
Niggas your grandfather's age, they pants still hangin' down they legs, talkin' about they ain't paid
And they hate you, ‘cause they say you ain't pay dues
And Slyvia Robinson was stealin' and robbin' them
I feel it's a problem we gotta resolve
Hip-Hop been dead, we the reason it died
Wasn't Sylvia's fault or because MC's skills are lost
It's because we can't see ourselves as the boss
Deep-rooted through slavery, self-hatred
The Jewish stick together, friends in high places
We on some low level shit, we don't want niggas to ever win
See, everybody got a label
Everybody's a rapper, but few flow fatal
It's fucked up, it all started from two turntables When they crown you and you rise up to your position
Carry on tradition
When they knight you, then you go to fight
Go to war, don't petition, carry on tradition
Carry on tradition, carry on, ca-carry on, carry on tradition
Carry On Tradition
When you rep what we rep, then carry on tradition Some of these new rappers got their caps flipped backwards
With their fingers intertwined in some gang-sign madness
I got an exam, let's see if y'all pass it
Let's see who can quote a Daddy Kane line the fastest
Some of you new rappers, I don't understand your code
You have your man shoot you, like in that Sopranos episode
Do anythin' to get in the game, mixtapes
You spit hate against bosses; hungry fucks are moraless
You should be tossed in a pit full of unfortunate vocalists
Niggas, I could've wrote your shit
I had off-time, was bored with this
I could've made my double-LP
Just by samplin' different parts of Nautilus
Still came five on the charts with zero audience
The lane was open and y'all was droppin' that garbage shit
Y'all got awards for your bricks – it got good to ya
You started tellin' them bigger dogs to call it quits?! WHAT? Now niggas got the studio poppin', it's mad clearer
Engineers got his earplugs and still hear us
The live-in-the-park sound versus the studio state of art sound. We on the charts now
From British Walkers and Argyles
Look at us rap stars now, with our black cars now
Fortune 500 listed, brunches, sip Cipriani's
Sippin', blunted, with rich white guys around me
Thick white girls around me, Chinese lined up
Because I'm what? Every dime lust
We used to be a ghetto secret; can't make my mind up
If I want that or the whole world to peep it
Now carry on tradition
Fuck a bum wack rapper makin' his career out of dissin'
Peace to the strugglin' artists and dead one's gone, we miss 'em. I promise I carry on tradition 
 The game's been good to me
My fans been good to me The money been good to me All I need though is this shit Talkin about I be rappin off track
Some of you square suckers be tryina say E-40 wack
Do your due dilligence in your research 'fore I pimp my pen
If you ain't never lived it and done it, you can't comprehend
I'm a fixture, a factor, somethin that you ain't
Respect my rank, you got none of that, point blank
I'm one of your favorite MC's favorite MC
Ask they ass, they know me
Bet you they tell you That boy right there got flows and creativity
That's the big homie
I'm authentic and real, I'm far from bein phoney
Originality is a must whenever I bust
Before I got into the rap game I was hustlin on the hush
Rock it up  dust, same color as pie crust
Penitentiary chances, shackles, chains and handcuffs
The first rapper talkin about triple-beam scales
Choppers, drought seasons and shit like that
I got some real niggas that'll vouch for that
Might not know how to freestyle but my rhymes'll paint a picture
Fuck bein a lyricist, I'm a fuckin game spitter
Pandemonium and chaos the price of bein a boss
That come with the package, I'm a savage, slightly throwed off
Grew up on $hort and Freddie B, Magic Mike and Calvin T
Dolemite and Blowfly, KRS and Ice-T
Melle Mel and Spoonie, just to name a few
UTFO, Kool Herc and Afrika Bambaataa, too  The game's been good to me
My fans been good to me
The money been good to me
G-O-D been good to me You all I need
You all I need
You all I need
You all I need I paved the way for indie labels
Ask Master P and Birdman what I brought to the table
Out the trunk independently
Sold hundreds of thousands of records with no video or airplay
Me and my uncle St. Charles
Suga, D-Shot, Legit, The Click, legends in this shit
But hold up, it don't stop there
If I got a dollar for every word I made up I'd be a billionaire
I'm the past and the present
I was sayin shit 20 years ago y'all niggas just now sayin
I done seen rappers come and go
Get they 15 minutes of fame, then you don't hear about them no mo'
Yeah, I done had my ups and downs
But the cold part about it is E-40 still around
I don't know why these suckers keep sayin I need to get my mumblin ass out the way
When I got a passion for rappin, partner, I don't do it just for pay
You oughta come to one of my concerts, you oughta come to one of my shows
I do my old school and my new school songs and all of them bitches go
They don't build 'em like me no mo', I'm a motherfuckin pro
A living legend, collection of classics, thought that you should know
You can't erase me out of history
I'm from the same place as CC
 The game's been good to me
My fans been good to me
The money been good to me
G-O-D been good to me You all I need
You all I need
You all I need
You all I need Third verse, more than half my life
Since teenagers, I gotta thank my wife
Since we was little young cubs
Born in the struggle, broke, livin off of love
This is the actual, not a non-theatrical movie
I thank God for my sons, Issue and Droop-E
Even though they divorced, my mama and my daddy
My sister, my brothers, my cousins and my family
I love y'all, and my fans when they hated
Were down with my futuristic ass way before I made it
And all my real ones with some balls
Went out funkin, beefin, feudin, niggas made some phone calls
Ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta - Pow!
Ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta - Pow!
Ratata-tat, put him on his back
Bust a sucker head 
The rap game's been good with me
Stuck when me when I didn't even have a penny
You lames can say what you like
But I been in it for 22, I gotta be doin somethin right
That means I'm not a overnight
Overnight sensation, didn't happen over night
I broke barriers for independence, mayne, I set the tone
They probably won't 'preciate me till I'm gone  The game's been good to me
My fans been good to me
The money been good to me
G-O-D been good to me You all I need
You all I need
You all I need
You all I need 
Yo I wake up every morning, shower, gather my belongings
Head to works, I get some breakfast cause, still a nigga yawning
From the night before, at the club I was up I'm trynna live
Only twenty two my nig, 'bout to be twenty three ya dig?
Yo I wake up every morning, shower, gather my belongings
Head to works, I get some breakfast cause, still a nigga yawning
From the night before, at the club I was up I'm trynna live
Only twenty two my nig, 'bout to be twenty three ya dig?
Time don't wait for none of us that's why I gotta chase my dreams
Make my momma proud so she can show off all her pearly teeth
And be half the man my dad was, I thank God he was in my life
I realize how many leave they wives so deep inside
Either I, need to make this music work or move from the Earth
I'm preachin' fire, need a choir, 'bout to take you all to church
My congregation bombed the nation with this hip hop
We in the race to fame, blowin' pass the pit stops
I heard the prize was some chicks and a wrist watch
And all you gotta do is go to jail or get shot
Yeah Nick cop but he ain't never get popped
How we gonna get pop fans? Give 'em a quick shot
Now I get ya chick hot with my wrist watch
Yeah shorty drip drop when it tick tock
It's kinda sick huh? Ay Jay, put an end to all the bickerin'
And tell them niggas this is Nick's spot
They don't keep it fresh enough I got it zip locked
Saran wrap, anthrax, it make ya sick huh?
I'm hot as fire wanna put me out with piss huh?
Reached to do it and realized his dick stuck It ain't as easy as it looks, we go through some shit
You cut us a check, then we go through some hits
Then you show us respect, then we'll say you legit
And this is the life that I lead from AM to PM I'm trynna get that cash, then watch how tall it grows
Soon as we get the ass, we start callin' 'em ho's
The concept you don't grasp, I'm guessin' you too old
And this is the life that I lead from AM to PM Ayo I stay up every evening, write that shit that they believe in
DJs run it, they approach me, and it's praise I be receiving
From the night befo', at the club, fake I.D. my record spins
Got me dancin' right outside since these niggas won't let me in
Well guess again, slip around the back and get it crackin'
And all the bottles wrapped in cellophane and party where the best have been
Hundred grand, Nickle F, that nigga's the next to win
Virgina gon' rep for him, and Memphis represent for me
To the tenth degree, Tennekey, T Dot to the country y'all
Orange Mound and Whitehaven, and back up north to Montreal
I ain't ashamed, my city ain't on the map
People get to thinking they really light that fire, realize they ain't born to rap
So they give it pass the torch and sell they soul for enough to throw cash in storage
Maybe they can bring they career back
But these niggas right here ain't trynna hear that
Cause I'm on set, make it work, break even on 9 to 5's
Cigarettes and lotto tickets, tryna keep that grind alive
All my uncles, they hit the casino when they get they check
My cousins, they paint they slabs and pop pistols to get respect
This can't be life, dominoes and chief and dro and twenty stacks
Single mothers phonin' cheaters just to get they honeys back
Purple drink and trips to Kroger's just to get they money stacked
Rest In Peace to SKUMMY this reality not funny rap!
You think it's funny till these youngings suck a bunny
Pull the jackrabbit out and get to screamin' where the money at?! None Hey Nas, hey hey boy, you see what they done did to Jimmy and Lee?
Mmmhmm. Damn, man
I can't take it man
Sho' can't
You think this is gonna eva' change?
Man, damn this place, man! Damn these chains! These damn chitlins every damn night
This cotton
Shit!
I can't take it man
Harriett done left the night befo'. It's time we go
Ain't no place for black folk here. Man, promise land callin' me man
It's callin' me too
It's time we go
Yeah, I'm wichou!
Hey man, hey damn these chains, man. Damn you master, you ain't my master, man!
You ain't nothin', you ain't nothin'
Hey Bandit, Bandit, get the dogs! Get the hounds, we gonna
Have ourselves a hangin' tonight! 1996!
Back up in this nigga
The right way, though, you know?

No doubt!

It was all written
(No question, I'm sayin' man, I mean, how we playin' man
You know what I'm sayin', they dealt us in, son
They playin' with a 54 deck, you see with the jokers in and everything, you know what I'm saying?)
Son, I'm playin' with the 52

But, yo, they takin' us into this next millennium, right now
(I'm sayin' law, you know what I'm sayin' we gotta lay the law
Cause without law ain't no order, you know what I'm sayin'
That's why these cats are slippin' through, you know what I'm sayin? They got the rules missin' though)
True

Son, these niggas look faker than the new hundred dollars, son

Word, with the big ass face on it
(Yo, what I'm sayin', we see through all that, though
You know what I'm sayin?)
No question

Yo, no doubt. In the Qu'ran it says Nas, the men
Nesa's the woman, you know? It was writtenNone Gather around. I'm glad everybody came out tonight. As we stand on our neighborhood corner, know that this fire that's burning represents the passion you have. Listen, Keisha, Tammy, come up front. I recognize all of you. Every creed and color. With that being said... fuck your ethnicity. You understand that? We gon' talk about a lot of shit that concerns you. All of you... Now everybody, throw your hands up high
If you don't give a fuck, throw your hands up high Now I don't give a fuck if you
Black, White, Asian, Hispanic, goddammit
That don't mean shit to me
Fuck your ethnicity, nigga Fire burning inside my eyes, this the music that saved my life
Y'all be calling it hip-hop, I be calling it hypnotize
Yeah, hypnotize, trapped my body but freed my mind
What the fuck is you fighting for? Ain't nobody gon' win that war
My details be retail, man, I got so much in store
Racism is still alive, yellow tape and colored lines
Fuck that, nigga look at that line, it's so diverse
They getting off work and they wanna see Kendrick
Everybody can't drive Benz's, and I been there, so I make it my business
To give 'em my full attention, ten-hut! Man, I gotta get my wind up
Man, I gotta get down with God cause I got my sins up
Matter of fact, don't mistake me for no fucking rapper
They sit backstage and hide behind the fucking cameras
I mosh pit, had a microphone and I tossed it
Had a brain, then I lost it, I'm out of my mind
So don't you mind how much the cost is, penny for my thoughts
Everybody, please hold up your wallets

Fuck your ethnicity, nigga I'm tired of y'all, cause everybody lied to y'all
And you believe it? Recognize them false achievements
It's treason and I'm Tylenol, I knock out when you knock it off
Knock on the doors of opportunity, I'm too involved
I'm no activist, I'm no Einstein before calculus
I was kicking that math, dropping that science
Like an alchemist, and I be kicking that ass, lyrically I'm UFC
If a UFO had came for me, I'mma come back with the head of an alien
Don't alienate my dreams, get it right
Get a life, I got two, that's a metaphor for the big shit I do
Boy, TMI, TSA, man I'm fly, put wings on my back
That a plane or an angel? Both like a pilot with a halo, whoa... gross I mean, I've seen so many things come through them, him, her, you
I'm just a messenger, yeah, I know life's a bitch, get the best of her
Put them 3's up, they notice that we up, HiiiPower

That don't mean shit to me
Fuck your ethnicity, nigga
Uh-huh uh yeah, gi-gi-geyeah
Time to come up, hold my own weight, defend my crown
Gots to lock it down and when they rush -- part two
Cocaine whiter now
Operation is sweet
Whole game tighter now
Moving a brick a week
Plus a nigga price is down
We them niggas to see
Time to start the arising now
I don't know what's wrong with Bleek It seems, I'm like Keenan, picking up on the vibe
That he ain't too happy, I could just see it in his eyes
I don't know if it's the chicks or how we dividing the loot
Time to pay his ass a visit 'fore he decide to get cute
Jumped out like a star with the flavest car
Matching the gator shirt, softer than my next door neighbors
These young niggas think I fell out the loop
'Cause the last time they seen me hopping out the Coupe
I hopped out in a suit
Look at this nigga Jay fronting, trying to take my shine
I didn't say this verbally, just had some shit on my mind
Plus I'm puffing like an ounce more than I used to puff
Taking advice from these niggas but they ain't used to stuff
They had me thinking, Shit, I'm the one that moved the stuff
While he drive around town in brand new Coupes and stuff
Swear to God, they had me practically hating his guts
As he approached I spoke, Jigga, whattup? I done came up 
Soaked the game up , now it's my time to shine
Time to change up , no more second in line
Nine-eight, these streets is mine
 Look at that fake smile he just gave me, it's breaking my heart
Should I school him or pull the tools out and just break him apart?
I felt his hatred it was harsh -- 'fore this faking shit start
I should take him in back of the building and blaze him
Uh-oh, this nigga Jay, he ain't slow, he musta picked up on the vibe
But had I not been so high, I woulda been able to hide
Tried to cover up myself, as I gave him a five
Hugged him as if I loved him, to the naked eye
It woulda seemed we was the closest, but to those that know us
Could see that something was about to go down
Stay focused, I'm trying to concentrate
But it's like he's reading my mind
As if he can see through this fog and all this weed in my mind
Could he see I had plans on, being the man
Ever since we first spoke and he put that G in my hand
And I gave it back to show him, I was down for the cause
As he approached 
Soaked the game up , now it's my time to shine
Time to change up , no more second in line
Nine-eight, these streets is mine
Yeah, you done came up 
Soaked the game up 
Time to change up, no more second in line
Nine-eight, these streets is mine Right, yo we wild out in Vegas, styled on haters
Mouthed off at the cops, outta cranberry drops
Copped whips the same color, we tighter than brothers
With different fathers but same mothers, this life don't love us
So 'til death do us, I'm never breaking my bond
Nigga, we Lex movers, V-12 pushers
As I stand
One leg of my pants up, in a stance like, And what?
I know these niggas are feeding my mind cancer
But in time's the answer 
Seems mind-blowing, this weed and Hennessy
Got my mind going, trust me nigga, I'm knowing
Chicks used to ignore me
And my aunt saying I need 50, not 60/40
Oh God, don't let him control y'all
Your gun is my gun, your clip is my clip, baby
Your fun is my fun , your bitch is my bitch
Any nigga trying to harm Jay, I'm feeling for you

 You'd feel the whirlwind blow you My daily dose is ferocious
I smoke dope, just as strong as opium
Hopin I'm close to just breakin frustration;
Speakin on podiums
Facin this cold world head-on, dead on arrivals
Young black, poor education guns crack
The gang violence done that
Nighttime, the guns blow, streets got snitches
Dealers, bitches, killers and blunt smoke, clubs open
Benzes, Jeeps, dubs pokin out tires
Thugs with heat, pay security, to let them slide in
Huh, I'm at the corner driftin, sippin, Cognac
To' back, know dat soldiers is packin no secret
Though I'm broken hearted women done left me hopeless in darkness
Smokin, driftin in sickness, stand by oceans watch the sun glisten
I'm soul-searchin, I'm soul-hurtin
What happens when money don't make you happy
I wish this on no person
Ate at the classy places, made all my fashion statements
I got no friends I'm lonely, don't want no pity save it Yo, ride in the nighttime, I'm high, got on my flight suit
Hood with the Nike sign, dark colors on
Pull up the block my brother's on
I hug him and we blow trees  Scopin for police
Guns on our hip, fiends want a fix, stumblin tricks 
We left the drug game alone
Brothers is jealous cause we still call the hood our home
What could you tell us?
At funerals my eyes swell up 
Look at my dog lay in the casket
Twin shotgun barrels had blasted
And rest in peace Barkin, is all I could whisper
As I paid respect, kissed his face and felt hard skin
It's part of God's plan, but why so many niggas have to die?
It's crowded in this place, let the priest and pastor by
Bandana covers my eye, I'm scopin through the room
I see killers and thieves, mob bosses and goons
And yet I feel responsible when my nigga's pronounced dead
Inside the hospital, I wish there's somethin I could do, but..

You think you can't be touched
Niggas disappear all the time Old Blue Eyes, Dogg Sinatra

Niggas disappear all the time None
Uh, man, fresh up out the sand, February tan
It's The Boy but I'm still the man, come and get your mans

It's a joke, but you say you real—I don't understand
On a yacht, me and all the dogs actin' like some dogs

Swear to God, shout to Buffalo, never duckin' low
I don't stop, man, I'm stuck on go, always hug the road

Want a lot, can't have everything but I want everything Bad attitude, tellin' who to calm down?
Tryna cool it all down, who's callin' my name?
Who's involved now? Tell me who I gotta down
I'll do a song now, man

Everything that went around is comin' back around
Y'all better hit the ground
Goddamn, beef forever unfinished

Had you all since beginnin'
Damn, I must be coachin', 'cause I'm not playin' with them

Man, my record deal should be 500 million, goddamn Can't have everything, can't have everything
Want a lot, can't have everything but I want everything Finally got my mind in a free state
Niggas tried to serve me up a cheesesteak
I gave them back a clean plate
Same niggas preein' cause they hate to see the team straight
Same niggas beakin', always duckin' my release dates
That's when the phone starts ringin' like, Are we straight?
Two-faced niggas back around with the three face
Damn, ol' triple double, Russ face, watch with the bust face
Never-met-the-plug-but-I-rap-about-the-plug face
Never-met-myself, I-don't-remember-who-I-was face
Y'all fuckin' hilarious
Y'all really think y'all niggas teamin' up is scarin' us
Y'all niggas is arrogant, y'all sleep at the Sheraton
All that shit embarrassin'
Tell your big homie I'm all for goin' there again
He ain't even die and I ball with his inheritance
All that's in my account at the Bank of America
All that Drake hysteria
6 side, East side, all that for my area You know, hun, I'm a bit concerned about this negative tone that I'm hearing in your voice these days. I can appreciate where your uncertainty stems from and you have reason to question your anxieties and how disillusioned you feel, as well as feeling skeptical about who you believe you can trust. But that attitude will just hold you back in this life, and you're going to continue to feel alienated. Give some thought to this, because I’m confident in you, and I know you can reach your desired destination and accomplish your goals much more quickly without this confrontation I'm hearing in your tone these days. When others go low, we go high.
As I met 2 Chainz a few minutes ago, as I gazed into his face, I felt that I was in the presence of royalty. There's a certain power presence that he gives off
I tried to be, everything you want and need 'Cause you got a deep title don't mean that you deep
Substance shallow on shit creek, I heard Cole speak
About the bricks, Kendrick got Compton lit
And I've been lit ever since I sold nicks
Never fabricated about my fabric, the scale, that's my apparatus
I give a fuck about the sorriest rappers
This actually happened, path in the back pathogenic
Moved that blow out like we were afrocentric
I had a front row entry, I had the codeine kidney
I made up the Bentiaga truck, you owe me a Bentley
This the rap Ken Griffey, got at least 10 with me
Got at least 10 on me, I'm anti-phony
My girl anti-bony and she get that money
I bought all this shit, don't go acting anti on me
It's Mr. Epps in the bank, I give a F what you think
I bought a Tesla today, there's nothing left in your tank
I did everything except a fucking song with Jay
But I murdered every song I fucking did with Ye
See my verses are better and my subject is realer
See my mom was an addict and my dad was the dealer
And their son is that nigga, I'm no Black activist
I'm a Black millionaire, give you my Black ass to kiss
We used the tree for a fence, I used to land in the trench
Used to dust myself off, then I eat me some shrimp
Coulda did anything, I coulda been me a pimp
I coulda went to the league, I took it straight to the rim
I took it straight to the block, I got Xans in my sock
I got plans for the pot, I got bands, you do not, huh Yeah, you a miracle. Right now, if you hear this, you're a miracle, I want you to know that. If you're able to hear this right now, you are a miracle. Straight up, no kapp I'm more Gucci than Vans, give you a Gucci advance
This the chance of your life, you ain't prepared for your life
See the man without a mic is just a mic gimmick
Anyone, Jordan, Jackson, Tyson, Bivens
Phone number unlisted
Gave her the digits to a number that is long distance
She on the wrong mission and got my palm itching
I had it on me, you can see it in my prom pictures, ugh I'm telling you, niggas like me fall out the sky. You don't just bump into me. I'm a real blessing, bro, nah, for real, bro You know the times is rough, you know the times is hard
I never trust my neighbors, so we got burglar bars
You know the times is rough you know the times is hard

You know the times is rough you know the times is hard
I never trust my neighbors so we got burglar bars
You know the times is rough you know the times is hard
I never trust my neighbors so we got burglar bars, Lord, Lord Lord knows
Woke up today, gave thanks
Grateful to see another day, then the storm came
As the night falls, I shed my blood, sweat and tears
Let the rain fall, let it fall, let it fall
One day
Your love will take me right over the stars, Lord knows That soulful trap music, man. Yeah, I'm talkin' 'bout Section 8, I'm talkin' 'bout the 'partments. You stay in the middle, someone stay on top of you, someone stay below you. What you know about grabbing a broom and shit and hitting upstairs like, Y'all stop fucking stomping! Y'all stop walking so mothafuckin' hard! Then the people downstairs, they doing the same shit to us. Tru, trill shit

But that fifty that break the bank
Back when my ATM was crazy slim, had a girl nicknamed Sprewell

It's time to hit the dancefloor, you crazy again
And get that cash money like Baby and Slim
Pull up in something tinted, so tinted she squinted
She said, This car real old, I told her her it was vintage
And I need to hit the health club and get a girl that's

Make her open wide like she made me her dentist
And let me get inside Now I've been hustling my whole life
Tryna get this money up and I think I finally got it right

So pour another glass of that good stuff
A couple more shots and I'll be doing fine Spit it to you, say little West the little beast

They say that all your old girls got somebody new
I said, Damn, really? Even Rose Mary? Even Leanne Sealey?
They said, Fucking right, they were the first to go, it's nothing personal
It's just that all them women that you slept on been working though
They've been saving up, new niggas came around, they been waking up
With I swear, you don't know this city anymore
They might have loved you before
But you're out here doing your thing, they don't know you
Ah, sure they do, they just not as sincere
It's crazy all the emotions forgot in a year
She like why you even give a fuck, you not even here?
Well, out there there ain't nothing for me and I think I need to come home Tell me, who did I leave behind?
You think it got to me, I can just read your mind
You think I'm so caught up in where I am right now
Uh, but believe I remember it all I be with my nigga Chubbs, he in love with street shit
No wonder why I feel awkward at this Fashion Week shit
No wonder why I keep fucking up the double-cheek kiss
And long for that ignorant Young Money Miami Beach shit
Couple artists got words for me, that's never fun
They say it's on when they see me, that day don't ever come
I'm never scared, they never real, I never run
When all is said and done, more is always said than done
And I was told once, things will change
By a nigga named Tip when my deal came
Told me it's all good, even when it feel strange
Now I'm that guy that know them strippers by their real names
Rochelle, Jordan
Thick bitches, they just talked me out of four grand
How'd a pile of kush become a mountain of truth?
How'd a bottle of wine become the fountain of youth?
Damn, my biggest fear is losing it all
Remember how I used to feel at the start of it
And now I'm living a mothafucking fairy tale
And still trying to keep you feeling a part of it
Yeah, just lie to my ears
Tell me it feel the same, that's all I've been dying to hear
Lights get low and that's when I have my brightest ideas
And I heard my city feel better than ever, that's why I gotta come home Tell me, who did I leave behind?
You think it got to me, I can just read your mind
You think I'm so caught up in where I am right now
Uh, but believe I remember it all My mother is back to who she was years ago
It's like a new page me and her are beginning on
I wish she'd stop checking up on women I can't stand
Cause I got new girls I could use her opinion on
She thinks I've become a slave to the wealth
But I'd never break the promises I made to myself
And I would never make up names for myself
Then change the names that I just gave to myself
Certain rappers would call me to say What up, though?
I used to brag about it to my friends
And now I'm feeling like all of these niggas cutthroat
And maybe that's all they do is just pretend
Damn, but I bought it though, I believed it
Yeah, I thought it and I achieved it
Yeah, so show me love, show me fucking love
Cause I thought it was all I needed
Yeah, clearly I was wrong about it all along
And this'll be the year that I won't even feel shit
They trip off the amount of people that I brought along
But I'm just trying to be surrounded by some real shit
Need credentials for every one of these Toronto kids
I promised they'd see it with me, we just trying to live
I told 'em we about to get it and we finally did
Listen closely to my shit -- I swear it's sounding like home Tell me, who did I leave behind?
You think it got to me, I can just read your mind
You think I'm so caught up in where I am right now
Uh, but believe I remember it all Well, you see, the way I feel about the music, it can be copied, you know?
But, it’s not copy do it, it’s the feel, you know? It carry a feel
Well, you ask plenty musicians -- them know it, but them can't do it
Some people still searching for this truth here Dick hard like rottweiler
Can you handle it? Can you handle it? Woo woo, woo woo The whole industry been in shambles
Everybody fugazi, I’m just changing the channel
Kendrick Lamar, the people’s champion, I'm animal for analysts
Career damaging verses, meditating with candles lit
I like my raps extra prolific
Since freestyling on lunch tables and park benches
And I won’t mention my ten thousand hours in training
While juggling, gang-banging, my balancing was tremendous
And now we look at the competition as quick submission
They tappin’ out before we even get a chance to miss ‘em
What this about, is it money or skill?
Maybe it’s both and I got large amounts of it, it’s real
You see my oath is very unbreakable, my style is never mistakable
I can see y’all incapable
To be the God emcees, you know me well
Ridiculous, venomous, hate in my heart, the sinister
Run for cover, my lineage prove itself
I’m rollin’ deep in that paper like two Adeles
Before scholars, I flowed tighter than virgin lips
We had to shake the game up and you're flying through turbulence
Everything is high stakes nowadays, that’s how it played nowadays
It’s like an 8-ball to the face nowadays
I'm laced nowadays, my gun is off the waist nowadays
It’s seven figures and retainer for the case nowadays, I'm talking
Higher power, every other hour since Eddie Bauer
Since stash boxes and lead showers, breaking the padlock
And the dead coward dying a thousand deaths, entire lion
Surround itself with bears, watch it nigga, you share a profit, ah!
This is what they want, I’m the one
This is vintage from nineteen-eighty-somethin'
I’m the son of the pioneer that got you near the sun
Play with him, bitch you better off voting for Donald Trump
I’m yelling Mr. Kanye West for president
He probably let me get some head inside the residence
I’m in the White House going all out
Bumping College Dropout, God-bless Americans
Nothing more influential than rap music
I merge jazz fusion with the trap music
I mix black soul with some rock and roll
They never box me in, I’m David Blaine-ing all you hoes
Oh yea, let’s go there, my DNA is DMT, I’m so rare
My Juvenile was wilder than the Nolia
A locomotive couldn’t track me down in my career
Runnin’ this shit with four pair, son of my bitch, I might demolish
A bitch right in front ya, chico, what have you done here?
D-Bo, all of it one year, Mississippi to California
It gets annoying, niggas wanna deploy him
And bitches wanna adore him, but industry shit ain’t for him
Probably thinking it’s for him, only one me
Swallowed the key and kicking the door in, never leasing my foreign
Mr. Valevictorian studied the game before them
Listen to you with boredom, baby rappers, abort them
To the grave I deport them, corporations extort them
I’m snapping off my endorphins, I alien mighty morphin’
My radiance rather gorgeous, hundred bill to the doorman
Hundred mil in my fortune, they call me back in the morning
You're racing against the tortoise, pace myself it’s important
Lace myself with the wisdom my playerism enormous
So pay the man for performance, saucy all of my garments
Jimi Kendrix performing, this fucking studio haunted 
I tell a bitch don’t sweat me 
I kill this whole fuckin’ beat if Cole let me 
Ib should’ve never sent the instrumental
Every time I start writing I get sentimental
This shit is just not fair
But why the fuck should I care?
The story of your life here
Two young stars was born and y’all gon’ die here
Oh Lord, gotta be the yams
Billboard list need 2Pac, damn
But number 9 makes sure he lives on, yeah
Hoochie, coochie, pussies in a trance
Every day a celebration, but even the valley peaking me
Is not validation, nigga this TDE
And my doggies be salivating, salaries, better ratings
And casualties all around me, don’t make me do demonstrations
Whoa
Murder my allegations and burning my finger traces
Adjourning my power patience and earning royalty payments
I’m sorry y’all not relating, this party is reservated
I kill this whole muthafucking beat if J. Cole say it
My nigga Ib chopped the instrumental, I gotta slay it
I gotta lay it, gotta show you fuckers I’m not to play with
The ruckus had been my favorite, King Kunta the fuckin’ greatest
Whoa
Burnin’ my leather-
 
Santana I see you, haha

Bumpin' the pistol out, do a X street nigga before I hollish
Got a whole lotta spit to talk about and a whole lotta speech to speak
The neighborhood fuck with 40 he be preaching mane he teeth
Some of these fools be boosie  rap about what they make
But at the end of the day, between me and you, they ain't got nothin to say 
Money don't make me I make money go hard for mine I'm smashed 
Instead of recall on my product customer satisfaction
Am I too early or are they too late?
Am I too blob or are they to slay?
Why do we go, when he goin slow?

Mixing and whippin' goop 
STEP IT UP! Don't get left behind 
Do some CATCHING UP! Put some ketchup on your fries 
BEATCH! Uhh!
Not all of the rappers but most of them sound alike 
I been rappin since most of em knew how to ride a bike 
On the dope track copping and flippin, pushing white 
Triple beam scales, scanners on that height 
Droomers, walking 'round with they spook on 
Grimming, standing in front of my momma's home 
Hubba rocks dowsers' cotton candy zones 
Zippers quarters half pound hole works 
Verify fixture gritter weight mover 
Burgundy mercury sixty-seven a cougar 
With the liquor dragging and gold tips, gold grill, gold weed
Gold rings, gold chain, gold every fuckin thang
Better learn how to swim or you gon fuckin sink 
If you don't work then you don't fuckin ate 
Crying complaining and whining ain't you 
How the fuck I'm a help you if you can't help you?
BEEATCH!  
Niggas know the boy whip game silly
Any time he in the city
In a continental Bentley
Ridin' around with a trunk full of sound
I'ma roll my windows down

Homie better be chill behind that wheel
Motherfucker, oh I know you don't wan' hit me
'Cause I know you can't afford the damage
Hot Spitta fuckin' every girl on campus
A god with the flow and y'all below average
I do it how I do it, I don't need no practice
Yeah, and for you haters tryna get me

Talkin' about them shots in a AK-47
Hit a nigga waistband, bring him all the way to heaven
Or hell, whatever you dwell

Before you fell a victim to the killin' Yeah, no matter where I'm at, no matter where a nigga be
I know a bitch nigga don't be hatin' on me

I guess that's why them niggas be hating on me
'Cause I got another nigga broad with me when I leave
I guess that's why them niggas be hating on me In the rap game, playing it wrong

Stuck mothers, sisters, aunt, nieces and daughters
Fuck Taco Bell

Cop a whole pie and you working wit a quarter
Stay cased up like my man Rhyme Slaughter
Sleep in crack spots on off that water
Y'all scrape up for weed money and grub
Me and my man roll in a Benz four dub
On our way to the club
Smoking weed out the jug
While most stay in court trying to plead with the judge

Fist and wrist stay glitered up

Never could back up that shit y'all be talking
I make you famous

Beenie Mack smoother than Jerome on Martin
I keep the silence on the three eighty loughton
Quiets the bus but can't do shit about this sparking
That's why I get my bodies right before darken
Your dogs ain't biting shit, just doing a lot of barking
Your squads leaking
Fronting like y'all eating
Rent a little car get dress on the weekend

Promiscuous, booch, sometimes we like to cheat

We off of them pills, and we ain't talking bout Bufferin

 with furniture in they mouth
If you like it, I love it, when it's dry, it's a drought
If you dig it, I dug it, be about your paper route
If it's woofers, then sub it, clientele and clout
Party and clubbing, up in the building talking loud We gon' act a ass 
We gon' do the fool 
So don't make me murdah 
Emcees up in side 
We gon' tap nigga and grind like that boy yeah
We gon' act a ass  I'm having my yay-per, I'm feeling my scrill

Gotta get it while its good, ain't no time to wait
It's dangerous in my hood but plenty money to make
I'm drinking a beer, I'm smoking a swisher
I barely can steer, I'm full of this liquor
I handles my biz, I'm taking my exit
The Carquinez Bridge, pimp, Magazine Street exit
I pull up my truck, I'm slapping my songs
Stop at the 7-11, talking shit on my phone
Hustler by nature , gangster by choice
I'm checkin' my pager, I'm checkin' my voice-
Re-up and re-coppin', peddlin' and pushin'
More keys than a janitor, my nickname is Bookman
Bitches be lookin', old-folk be starin'
Pattin' me down, searchin' the clothes that I'm wearin' We gon' act a ass 
We gon' do the fool 
So don't make me murdah 
Emcees up in side 
We gon' tap nigga and grind like that boy yeah

Underrated and hated on by all these squares in the industry
Mayne, I'm a legend, pimp, they call me E-Four-O
Ex D-boy used to push that blow
Gas, break, dip, stop, and go
Ride the strip, hit the sto'e
You know that I bought it, you know that I got it
Had to cop a bottle of the blue Hpnotiq
Incredible Hulks, you know what I mean
Mix it with some dark and watch that shit turn green
Higher than an elephant's eye, me and my guys
Off the broccoli and hash, actin a ass... We gon' act a ass

We-we-we came a long way
Ladies and gentlemen..
Na-Na-Na-Nastradamus

Na-Na-Na-Nastradamus* Yo..
Yo.. yo..
Power and crime, the thugs slinging powder and dimes
Twenties of D, is yo' niggas wilder than mine?
My niggas bust nines, puff lye and stick up cowards
For they shine, you resist, then you push up flowers
I'm like Luca Brasi, Vito's best hit-man
That's Godfather shit, back seat, next lit plans
Revolvers spit, I'm too tough to bargain with
And you don't want the God to pull up the cars that's sick
Arms and wrists is lit up, Queensbridge Kings
Plaques, awards, applause when I do my thing
Streets is black as midnight, the concrete gray
With stains of blood and germ and piss all day
Come on the ave, get sized up, plus appraised
Duck and pray that my guns don't bust your way
Niggas with names, living off reputation
Sometimes gotta remind you ain't nothing changing Ladies and gentlemen..
Na-Na-Na-Nastradamus
Everybody watch him} If you ill come get me, 'cause I ain't running
If your gun's off the hook then we'll both be gunning
Come get me if you real, 'cause I ain't scared
It's all fair in love and war and I'm well prepared
If you ill come get me, 'cause I ain't running
If your gun's off the hook then we'll both be gunning
Come get me if you real, 'cause I ain't scared
It's all fair in love we can take it there You don't like me clown? Now you wanna take me down?
If I bring my face around, you gon' do what? You butt
Your crew knew I blew up, I been shining - baseball diamonds
Dick rings for your chicklings
Niggas know what my nine pearl handle's about
Fuck you say girlie mouth? Get it krunk like the Dirty South
And I know you see me flossed out, multi-milli-i
Hear your bitch talk about me, you give her the cold eye?
Girls dig you, imagine what she feel for me?
You make hot songs, but she know you steal from me
Who ill as me? I wild on haters in album three
Next level - I take y'all niggas to 3-D
Can't find a nigga shook from Queens
I'll be with the most grimy killers
 and they all look clean
Who put bombs underneath cars, if you want beef then start
Your next stop is to the graveyard If you ill come get me, 'cause I ain't running

Come get me if you real, 'cause I ain't scared
It's all fair in love we can take it there You too feminine to kill again, jail got you soft
You talk but you scared to go back up North
Keep your face twisted, but you don't really want nothing
Talk a bunch of shit motherfucker and stop fronting
You don't wanna flip again, and sell drugs again
Be on the run again, catch you at the Comfort Inn
Shoot up your door, bust in on you and your whore
Put y'all in bags, clean the blood off of the floor
So play tough, I want y'all to get out of line
I got nines, every color shape and design
I sent killers every race to put one in your spine
Two in your ear, get your crew, who do I fear?
Nobody never get involved and none of 'em dying
I think like you do, roll with about two irons
Catch me flying, high in the aircraft wining
- and dining, you die, then we laugh, you bitch-ass
The rich ass, they gauze up, your stab wounds
While I'm getting head, in a Lear jet, bathroom
With all my goons, all my ice, and suitcases
Full of paper, not money it's bank statements
The Illmatic that explains how we rock
Yachts and co-ops, we buy the hood and sell you a block If you ill come get me, 'cause I ain't running
If your gun's off the hook then we'll both be gunning
Come get me if you real, 'cause I ain't scared
It's all fair in love and war and I'm well prepared
If you ill come get me, 'cause I ain't running
If your gun's off the hook then we'll both be gunning

Substitute teacher, Mr. Buckwort
The topic Fo' today is, what you wanna be when you grow up
You, over there in the jean shirt, what you wanna
Be when you grow up?
- I wanna be a police officer
Alright, that's a pretty good profession
You over there in that black shirt
What you wanna be when you grow?
- I wanna be a fire man
Alright, that's a pretty good profession too
You, back there in those french braids, what's yo name?
- my name is Snoop
Alright Snoop, what you wanna be when you grow up?
- I wanna be a motherfuckin hustla, ya betta ask somebody So you call yourself a god MC, J-Hova
Drunk the glass of blasphemy and forgot to pray over
Your game's over
Crossed the warpath of a brave soldier
You're a makeover
My protege trying to Takeover
I was the shepherd that led you
But you bit the hand that fed you
Mad 'cause since I met you I never did respect you
And as hard as it seems
You know that I fathered your dreams
You was a groupie always begging to be part of my team
Another case of a boy and his teacher
I was the first to poison your speakers
So kill all that noise that you're preaching
I understand, all your plans to underhand
Aired threats of you pullin' my card next Summer Jam
Let me make this clear Hova
You had my left overs
She told me your little problem of the day when you slept over
But that's another subject homey
 you phony
I'm coming to collect the debt from the years that you owe me
So what you capitalized, only cause I allowed
I'm taking aim at your dome
And reclaiming my throne
Who said I that I ain't still nasty? How you planned on facing
The half man half-amazing
Don't need a fam', Nas is a one man invasion
Claim you hot but you flopped with your R.O.C-familia
'Cause real recognize real and you're not familiar
Call yourself gangsta' but you were begging for pardon
That night in Carbon, when Terror Squad flipped on your squadron
Tried to front on their checks
Till Pun put a gun to your chest
You said it yourself dog, Nas is one of the best
Don't need to search for some dirt to expose you
I leave it up to the flow dispose you
When I oppose you
This is it, I'm calling ya'
Come out and play like “warriors”
Studied my blueprint then pieced together your formula
Guess the knowledge I speak too deep to follow
That's why your stomach too weak to swallow
The real truth that Nas is the greatest of all timers
Fuck skeletons, keep only weaponry in my closetsCan't Knock The Hustle Ok
Alright
Hey
This song right there
Was off the first album I ever made
It's called Reasonable Doubt
Also was fortunate enough to be blessed by the presence of
The Queen of, just the Queen man
I wanna say R&B, I wanna say hip hop
Her name is Ms Mary J. Blige
Mary!
Let me get all the way up beside you girl
You ready?

I'm making short term goals when the weather folds
I just had to test y'all I'm making short term goals when the weather folds
Just put away the leathers and put ice on the gold
Chilly with enough bail money to free a big willie
High stakes, I got more at stake than Philly
Shopping sprees, cop in three
Deuce fever IS's fully loaded, ah, yes
Bouncing in the Lex Luger, tires smoke like Buddha
50 Gs to the crap shooter
Y'all can't fade me, chrome stocks beaming
Through my peripheral I see you scheming
Stop dreaming, I leave your body steaming
Player's is fiending, what's the meaning
I'm leaning on any player intervening with the sound of my money machining
My cup runneth over with hundreds
I'm one of the best player's that done it
Six digits and running, y'all dudes don't want it
I got the Godfather flow, the Don Juan DeMarco
Mary! I'm taking out this time
To give you a piece of my mind

Who do you think you are

Baby one day you'll be a star Last seen out of state where I drop my sling
I'm deep in the South kicking up top game
Bouncing on the highway switching four lanes
Screaming through the sunroof, money ain't a thang
Your worst fear confirmed
Me and my fam roll tight like The Firm
Getting down for life, that's right, you better learn
While I play with fire, you burn
We get together like a choir, to acquire what we desire
We do dirt like worms, produce G's like sperm
Until legs spread like germs
I got extensive with expensive clothes
And I sip fine wines and spit vintage flows
What y'all don't know
Uh Uh Uh Uh
Cause you can't knock the hustle But until then lately, I'm the one who's crazy?

Cause that's the way you're making me feel

I'm just trying to live right

I don't have the time
To knock the hustle for real Yo, lunching, punching the clock
My function is to make much and lay back munching
Sipping Remy on the rocks, my crew
Nothing to stop, un-stoppable
Scheme on the ice, I got to hot your crew
I got to, let you dudes know the time like Movado
My motto, stack rocks like Colorado
Waddle off the champagne, Cristals by the bottle
It's a damn shame what you're not though 
Slick like a gato, ya boy Jay-Z
My pops knew exactly what he did when he made me
Tried to get a nut and he got a nut and what

Straight bananas; can a nigga see me
Got the US Open, advantage Jigga
Serve like Sampras, play fake rappers like a campus
Le Tigre, Pa you're too eager
You ain't having it
Oh good me either
Let's get together and make this whole world believe us huh
At my arraignment screaming
All us blacks got is sports and entertainment, until we even
Thieving, as long as I'm breathing
Can't knock the way a player eating
Alright I'm taking out this time

To give you a piece of my mind
Who do you think you are

Baby one day you'll be a star

But until then lately, I'm the one who's crazy?

Cause that's the way you're making me feel

I'm just trying to get mine I don't have the time
To knock the hustle for real
 Family Affair  People can we get it crunk tonight

Yeah yeah yeah
Let's get it
Let's get it
Let's get it

(One more time for Ms Mary J Blige y'all
Ok, alright. We might be at 8, we close we close. Alright, I got you Mami, let's slow it down one time)
I hear you, I hear you, L-Boogie
Remember they used to call you that?
What you say, Lauryn?
You just keep singing, I'mma tell 'em
Oh when it all, it all falls down
I'm telling you all when it all falls down
 Man I promise, she's so self conscious
She has no idea what she doing in college
That major that she majored in don't make no money
But she won't drop out, her parents will look at her funny
Now, tell me that ain't insecurr
The concept of school seems so securr
Sophmore three yurrs ain't picked a carurr
She like fuck it, I'll just stay down hurr and do hair
Cause that's enough money to buy her a few pairs of new Airs
Cause her baby daddy don't really care
She's so precious with the peer pressure
Couldn't afford a car so she named her daughter Alexis
She had hair so long that it looked like weave
Then she cut it all off now she look like Eve
And she be dealing with some issues that you can't believe
Single black female addicted to retail and well Oh when it all, it all falls down
Uh, and when it falls down who you gon' call now?
Oh when it all, it all falls down
C'mon c'mon, and when it falls down Man I promise, I'm so self-conscious
That's why you always see me with at least one of my watches
Rollies and Pashas done drove me crazy
I can't even pronounce nothing, pass that versace!
Then I spent 400 bucks on this
Just to be like, Nigga, you ain't up on this!
And I can't even go to the grocery store
Without some Ones that's clean and a shirt with a team
It seems we living the American Dream
But the people highest up got the lowest self-esteem
The prettiest people do the ugliest things
For the road to riches and diamond rings
We shine because they hate us, floss cause they degrade us
We trying to buy back our 40 acres
And for that paper, look how low we a stoop
Even if you in a Benz, you still a nigga in a coupe Oh when it all, it all falls down
Uh, and when it falls down who you gon' call now?
Oh when it all, it all falls down
C'mon c'mon, and when it falls down I say fuck the police, that's how I treat 'em
We buy our way out of jail, but we can't buy freedom
We'll buy a lot of clothes but we don't really need 'em
Things we buy to cover up what's inside
Cause they make us hate ourself and love they wealth
That's why shorties holler, Where the ballers at?
Drug dealer buy Jordan, crackhead buy crack
And the white man get paid off of all of that
But I ain't even gonna act holier than thou
Cause fuck it, I went to Jacob with 25 thou
Before I had a house and I'd do it again
Cause I wanna be on 106 & Park pushing a Benz
I wanna act ballerific like it's all terrific
I got a couple past-due bills, I won't get specific
I got a problem with spending before I get it
We all self-conscious I'm just the first to admit it Oh when it all, it all falls down
Uh, and when it falls down who you gon' call now?
Oh when it all, it all falls down
C'mon c'mon, and when it falls down Don't stop that shit, keep that shit
Keep that part where I ran out of breath
We ain't doing no punch-ins, man
That's that fake shit
If I was on stage, how I gotta spit it?
It's from the heart anyway
Might cause shortness of breath, ya know?
Couldn't have got nobody better for the job
Thank you very much this a beautiful
Beautiful young lady that's inspired me definitely
Fuck with me it's going to be a candlelight 
Fuck with me your homies gonna have a candlelight 
100 Remy bottles at the candlelight 
Baby-mommas cryin' at the candlelight 
Luggies, these two two three's we spittin' 
Karma will catch up wit' yo past 
Lamas'll split yo house in half 
Blast first ask questions later 
Black hearse, closed caskets 
Caravans, funeral task 
Drive slow, not fast 
Lights on in the daylight 
It was on in Sinight  
3 to the dome at the stop sign 
A week ago at midnight, rewind 
Momma on the street fallin' out 
Beating on the ground screaming shout 
Daddy in the half-way house 
On his way home, gettin' out 
An eye for an eye
A tooth for a tooth
Name tagged on the wall; no truce, bulletproof
Can't be caught loose- slippin'
Slippery at the tongue
It was all over a bitch when it's said and done Fuck with me it's going to be a candlelight 
Fuck with me your homies gonna have a candlelight 
100 Remy bottles at the candlelight 
Baby-mommas cryin' at the candlelight 
Pull up on the side of you and leak ya 
Turn your vehicle into a shootin' range 
Let them guns bark like some great-danes 
Ulterior motives and hidden agendas
Never know who you sitting down and having dinner with
These smirky muthafuckas ain't shit
And these rabbit ass bitches will do anything for some dick
I was taught by the OG's, lace me mane
When I was nine years old a student of the game
Used to be the lookout kid when them boys came
HIDE YOUR BUNDLES -That's what I used to scream
A solid muthafucka, concrete 
Never tell if i'm in a hot seat 
Bounce back if I am having a loosing streak 
Can't be seven days, can't be week/weak 
Money on my mind pockets full c-notes
Throwing up my street sign like a first-base coach
Heavy on the grind all the fuckin time
Bitch i want a 100 like a Dayton Spoke
Nice guys finish last and stay broke 
Bad guys finish first and push dope 
Make it past 25, it's America 
Got to be mo' carefulJ.Cole wrote a beautiful and moving apology to individuals and families affected by autism who were understandably hurt by a verse in Jodeci Freestyle. I share responsibility and offer my sincerest apologies for the pain this has caused. Individuals with autism have brilliant and creative minds, and their gifts should not be disparaged or discounted. This was a learning lesson for both of us, and I’m grateful for the opportunity to try to right this wrong. J. Cole and I believe that it is the right, responsible, and respectful decision to remove the lyric from the song.707 breh I'm throwing up the V

I'm 'bout to buy a hog, I'm bringin' home the bacon I remember you was conflicted
Misusing your influence
Sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power, full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screaming in the hotel room
I didn’t wanna self destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went running for answers
Until I came home
But that didn’t stop survivor’s guilt
Going back and forth trying to convince myself the stripes I earned
Or maybe how A-1 my foundation was
But while my loved ones was fighting the continuous war back in the city, I was entering a new one
A war that was based on apartheid and discrimination
Made me wanna go back to the city and tell the homies what I learned
The word was respect
Just because you wore a different gang color than mine's
Doesn’t mean I can’t respect you as a black man
Forgetting all the pain and hurt we caused each other in these streets
If I respect you, we unify and stop the enemy from killing us
But I don’t know, I’m no mortal man, maybe I’m just another nigga
I know you're tired of loving, of loving
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody So just grab somebody, no leaving this party
With nobody to love, nobody, body What you doing in the club on a Thursday?

And we gone 30 hours
30 hoursI know everyone is enjoying the circus but I want to clarify this image in question. This was not from a clothing brand shoot for my music career. This picture is from 2007, a time in my life where I was an actor and I was working on a project that was about young black actors struggling to get roles, being stereotyped and type cast. The photos represented how African Americans were once wrongfully portrayed in entertainment. Me and my best Friend at the time Mazin Elsadig who is also an Actor from Sudan were attempting to use our voice to bring awareness to the issues we dealt with all the time as black actors at auditions. This was to highlight and raise our frustrations with not always getting a fair chance in the industry, and to make a point that the struggle for black actors had not changed muchVerse 1: Rick Ross]

Two forks, two pots, I could whip it both-handed
My girl is bow-legged, just do it like Bo Jackson
Every beat I'm toe-tagging, charm big as a Volkswagon
Money got me sagging, it really doesn't matter
I run circles round these niggas' world like Saturn Black Foamposites, it's like we on that mobbing shit
Riding five deep and I'm as dirty as them congressmen
Sixty-two, without no tint; missing roof on my new shit
Ironic since my drive increased, my driver see the profit
Yeah, work, fuck you niggas, pay me though
Smoke that Mark McGwire strong, Oakland ain't no basic smoke
Shout-out to your lady, a.k.a. MMG favorite ho

Let em play with the crick in the truck
Many chicks wanna put Jigga's fists in cuffs
Divorce him and split his bucks
Just because you got good sex, I'mma break bread
So you can be living it up
Part with nothing, I be fronting

Hurricane Katrina victim in the building
Okay, day time soldier, night time rider
911 survivor, yeah I feel you
And who am I to try to keep hope alive
When I'm seeing dead babies floating by
Damn, burning buildings, flamed up
They couldn't take da heat so they jumped
Man, they want to want to transform the streets we grew up on
A deck of cards with no aces: luck gone
Uhh, tower 1 fell, tower 2 fell
Now everybody screwed like loose nails
I'm like what are we to do with a house with no roof
Look up and pray to whose above you
God, yeeup, now just look in your seat
Black people, white people, all covered in debris, yeaah When the levees broke
When the planes hit
What's going on my nigga
You know the same shit
After Katrina, after the towers
We holds our heads high after disaster When the levees broke
When the planes hit
What's going on my nigga, the same shit
After Katrina, after the towers
We holds our heads high after disaster Try to keep our head up, and not get fed up 
But it seems like they won't let us live
Yea, and I was told that life ain't shit and this world ain't neither
This is why I scream fuck the world not the people 
Yes, but in the belly of the beast
People get swallowed like meat, eat
And your president was lying while my people was dying
In the helicopter flying looking down reading signs
Help! SOS, somebody save us
Ten dead inside, where our savior
And, I've seen tragedy I've looked it in the eye
Hate being at my lowest so I choose to get high
High, so high, that my name should be sky
It's a bird, it's a plane, no it's I
Yea, I holla five on four till they bury me man
I'm the father of New Orleans and I'm a family man
You heard me When the levees broke
When the planes hit

We holds our heads high after disaster When the levees broke
When the planes hit
What's going on my nigga, the same shit
After Katrina, after the towers
We holds our heads high after disaster Now, if I should die before my time, Lord
Take care of Jew Jew and his mom 
Take care of little Jah 
Take care all the kids 
'Cause through us they live
Yeah, lord please keep your eyes on me
And if I die, I pray my soul you keep
And I don't want this world to kill me, but I'm getting so weak
I can't take much more, I just want to be free
Free, they said they knew there was a problem with the levees, and they did nothing 
Clinton approved the money, and Bush did nothing 
So, Katrina hit, and three days later, Fema just comin'
I'm feeling like what the hell is really goin' on
Planes into buildings, what's next King Kong?
I wish we didn't even have a reason for this song 
To those restin' in peace, those dead and deceased, soon again we meet 
Or 'til I'm high and drunk and my car swerves off road, haa
I'll meet you at the crossroads
Lord, please keep your eyes on me
And if I die, I pray my soul you keep
And i don't want this world to kill me, but I'm getting so weak
I can't take much more, I just wanna be free When the levees broke
When the planes hit
What's going on my nigga
You know the same shit
After Katrina, after the towers
We holds our heads high after disaster When the levees broke
When the planes hit
What's going on my nigga, the same shit
After Katrina, after the towers
We holds our heads high after disasterIf you're given a voice, you have to take that seriously. For me it's a, it's a fight cause most people are just satisfied with it's good. Most people are satisfied by just a ten or something. It's not to just stop at ten, you know, ten is ground zero. Perfection is ground zero. We need to take things to a genius level. I can only create so much with this GQ shoot. But I'mma try the best I can. I'mma get tailored pants, put tones together so I will be creative in my own space. You know, it's fine if people like me. It's fine if they dislike me. I'd rather take a chance and being hated. To bring that type of creation to the world
Uh, letter to my dad that I never wrote
Speeches I prepared that I never spoke
Words on a paper that I never read
Proses never penned, they stayed in my head
Jotted on dotted lines, I'ma fight you, nigga
From stories that I heard, I'm just like you, nigga
Must've been some pain in your past, too
Must've been a karma that was past due
Must it be the energy that passed through
Must've been a pastor, many snafus
Started a good man, you married my mama
I was in her belly, you hurried that Summer
She had two kids from a previous mister
One family, I don't believe in half-sisters
Never treated my brother like a step, Pop
Remembered the many lessons when we stepped out What was you preparing us... for? Did you see the runt as the front-runner
Leader of the pack, you see that in your youngins
What ancestors did you summon to the summit
To give me what I needed, what you need to take from 'em
The tsunamis that I swum in to become in
Had the cable with the anchor for the places that I sunk in
Unc in a better place but you couldn't function
Shot junk in your arms, more than your veins was punctured
I punted on feelings, 'cause you said you was coming
You couldn't kick the habit, I wish you said something
You can't avenge these many sins with your own hands
You wanna make God laugh, just tell him your plans
Who would've thought I'd be the dad I never had
Be the husband I've become, usually nothing come from that
I forgive you as I live through the beautiful present of the past
I'm just thankful that I get all these gifts to unwrap What were you preparing us... for?Baby let's roll away
Get lost in the day
I love that you love what you do
And just like any girl, baby I'll love you the same
I know you gotta go, the DJ is calling you to the stage
Go ahead baby, do your thing
Honey complexion
Body of a goddess
22s on the Lexus, named Alexis
By the way of Texas
Big face Rolexes
While she's undressing, man I'm stressing
She's extremely blessed
Extremely blessed
Give us this day our daily bread
If you a chicken head, go somewhere and lay some eggs
I make you, make your bed, take that head
Got a move that will break your leg, know what Im talking about
Known to kill pussy, nigga chalk it out
Our first date was the Waffle House
Different day, different escapades
If they dont like it they opinions like Escalade's
Everybody got one
Yeahh
She slow grinded the whole time
I told her have a seat, you sitting on a gold mine
Big ass, long hair, thick thighs
Eat Lobster tail like French Fries
Im the type to buy you a car for the fifth time
This skinny nigga doing big time
Oh wait, dinner dates I demonstrate how to penetrate
If you ain't wit it, then its elimi-date
Baby lets roll away
Get lost in this day
Say its okay
Come to me
Extremely blessed
I'm so far ahead of my time I'm 'bout to start another life
Look behind you; I'm 'bout to pass you twice
Back to The Future, gotta slow up for the present; I'm fast
Niggas can't get past my past
How you propose a deal with the perfect present?
When I unwrap The Gift & The Curse in one session?
Ain't no living person can test him
Only two resting in Heaven can be mentioned in the same breath as him
7 straight summers; critics might not admit it
But nobody in rap did it quite like I did it;
If you did, I done it before
You get it, I had it;
I got mad at it, I don't want it no more
And that comes from everything, from flippin' that raw
Flippin' whores, flippin' vocal cords
Don't get it twisted, get it right
Did it different, did it better, did it nice
Did the impossible, and then I did it twice
Young! Young H.O., fresh from Italy
Trip financed by my best ability
Same one helped me in extra realty
For my mom, for my nephews, a bunch of lil' me's
Flip flop by Versace, hip-hop got me here
Music made me a millionaire, yeah
Multi for what's inside of here
Inside my heart, besides that, I'm smart
Prepare poems with a passion, at the same time cash in
Took the best of both worlds minus the madness
Though controversy follows me everywhere I dock
Everything I hear I block
Out like the jealous clouds do the sun
Then I sit back and recline since my shine has shone
And then sure nuff bust out something foreign with the doors up
Maybe the lilac Porsche
The lavender Retriever
I only bring my homies back purple reefer
I only smoke in Ibiza
In Capri, somewhere foreign that you need your visa
Yup, Hovi's home; but it's like I never left, I had the global phone
Yup, yeah I stayed in touch
I heard y'all back home complaining, y'all complain too much
So hateful, bunch of dudes I put on out there acting so ungrateful
But daddy's home, and he brought the forty autie-matie chrome
For all the chatty-chatty y'all been doing While y'all was running your mouth complaining about Summer Jam
I was in flip-flops in the South of France
See how it flip-flops with the number one station for hip-hop and r&b?
You thought Summer Jam was starring you? It was starring me
Even in my absence, my presence is felt
That gotta tell you I'm the king, dog, if nothing else
I'm on another continent, you still ain't content
I'm in the Mediterranean, you still ain't vent
Explain to me why I want to be you again
You on the radio crying, I'm learning to swim
Swipping and swapping the foreigns 
You niggas cannot ignore it
I’m swippin’ and swappin’ the foreigns
Swipping and swapping the foreigns 
I’m swipping and swapping the foreigns
Might go to church in some Jordans
I might go buy me a chopper
Then I’mma buy me a lawyer
I got a check from the barn
I got a neck full of bone
I got a neck full of Bentley
Maserati on my arm
I get that bread in the morning
Somebody pass the croissants
Somebody pass me a lighter
Somebody pass me a joint
I’m using my rap for intimidation
Using my gat for a demonstration
If my car ever got impounded
It would be locked up for illegal immigration
That’s a small thing to a Godzilla
Got me more bars than a bartender
I met a car dealer, my car came with wine
And yours came with some malt liquor
Swipping and swapping the pack suit
I wish I had me some ack
The bitch that I’m with is foreign
On our first day I had took her to sex Swipping and swapping the foreigns
Balenciaga performer
I think it’s time for war
I might go battle in my armor
And if I kill you, it’s karma
I will not tolerate shit
The youngin be thugging his own 
Advise you not to get hit
I do this shit for my momma
I been in this shit since pajamas
These niggas don’t mean me no harm
You come any closer you’re gonna need arms
I promise, because niggas ain’t seeing me really
I ride the choppa to Denis
And they say the choppa be kissing
Don’t play, you’ll be left with the hickies
I beat up the bully
Hopped in the bed with a witch
Switch up on all of you niggas
My bitch is foreign
She always touring, she bored
Might have to switch up the foreign on bitches
Fucking with Chainz
Might gonna see me on tour-ling, nigga
He put them forgies on everythang
Even the spinner, goddamn! What, what...yeah I ain't seen as much death, nor seen as much crime
Since the blackout in Queensbridge in '79
Everybody's a killer now; pimps, playas, and dons
Shorties on the block push drops and carry on
Niggas look through our window wherever we drove
Through the tint, to see if the Benz is matching the clothes
We the Queens kings, I used to view the cats that are old
Seeing things that made me real from my skin to my soul
Girls who turned hoes, friends who turned foes
Bad luck niggas who bring death wherever they go
Never sleep, it feels better to know
It's all real though Everything is real
Where we Headed now?
Up to more money, would be more fun
Leave with mo' bitches, carry more guns
Where we headed now? Where we going, yo?
It's getting real, son; we gon' let it flow
Where we Mo' bitches, it be more dough
It be more fun, holding more... How the hell are we supposed to excel from the street
Where the Jake's crew face young kids who wanna eat?
Quantum Leap to this Black world, hustlers and ghettos
Self-made millionaires who tussle with the devil
Bust a lil metal lead, wrestle you, to the pebbles
On the hard ground, that's if your guard down
It's a struggle, brothers jump bail
To come chill with they niggas on the block, with them rocks for sale
On the horn with the god Shapelle, my Queens comrade
Yo, run and come in with the dime bag Ayo, I need dat, I got to smoke dat
Send me some Chunky Black, so I could smoke away the pain
Try to find my brain, but the thought still remain
Yo, it's on again once the death stunts these chains
'Cause I been through it; the drug game, I thought I knew it
I got knocked, took it to trial, but I blew it
25, but only lived 20 years of my life
Took 5 from me; got me wrapped up like a mummy
Now I'm in the system a.k.a. the devil's home
Where they tell you where to eat, sleep, shit, and use the phone
Now I'm living with, drug dealers, and chain stealers
Bitch niggas who got knocked and turned squealers
Imagine, sharing a cell with a rehabilitated addict
Who love fucking with faggots, but I civilized the savage
I sat him down and made him study mathematics
Now I'm sitting in the cell thinking...
About this reefer I'ma get this weekend
On the V.I., I rather be... uh, damn, damn
Now greetings to the world

But suckers don't wanna see other brothers get cash

Where there's more hate than love, where clients plot on their plug
Turn on their own flesh and blood, do em dirty just like a rug...

Bitch Whose fault? Let's play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you more
Let's call out names, names for sure I'll call you bitch for short
As a last resort and my first resort
You call me motherfucker for long
At the end of it, you know we both were wrong But I love to play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you more
Let's call out names, names for sure On a bathroom wall I wrote
I'd rather argue with you than be with someone else
I took a piss and dismiss it like fuck it
And I went and found somebody else
Fuck arguing and harvesting the feelings
Yo, I'd rather be by my fucking self
Till about two a.m. and I call back
And I hang up and I start to blame myself
Somebody help Let's play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you more
Let's call out names, names for sure You weren't perfect but you made life worth it
Stick around, some real feelings might surface
Been a long time since I spoke to you in a bathroom
Gripping you up, fucking and choking you
What the hell was I supposed to do?
I know you ain't getting this type of dick from that local dude
And if you are I hope you have a good time
Cause I definitely be having mine
And you ain't finna see a mogul get emotional
Every time I hear bout other niggas is strokin' you
Lying, say I hit you, he sitting there consoling you
Rubbin' my name through the mud, who's provoking you?
You should be grateful a nigga like me ever noticed you
Now you noticeable and can't nobody get control of you
1AM and can't nobody get a hold of you
I'm calling your brother's phone like what was I supposed to do?
Even though I knew, he never told the truth
He was just gon' say whatever that you told him to
At a certain point I had to stop asking questions
Y'all got dirt on each other like mud wrestlers
I heard he bought some coke with my money
That ain't right girl
You getting blackmailed for that white girl
You always said, Yeezy, I ain't your right girl
You'll probably find one of them I like art-type girls
All of the lights, she-was-caught-in-the-hype girl
And I was satisfied being in love with the lie
Now who to blame, you to blame, me to blame
For the pain and it poured every time when it rained
Let's play the blame game Let's play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure Things used to be, now they not
Anything but us is who we are
Disguising ourselves as secret lovers
We've become public enemies
We walk away like strangers in the street
Gone for eternity
We erased one another
So far from where we came
With so much of everything, how do we leave with nothing?
Lack of visual empathy equates the meaning of L-O-V-E
Hatred and attitude tear us entirely - Chloe Mitchell Let's play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you, more
Let's call out names, names, for sure I can't love you this much, I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much, I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much, no, I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much, I can't love you this much And I know that you are somewhere doing your thing
And when the phone called it just ring and ring
You ain't pick up but your phone accidentally called me back
And I heard the whole thing
I heard the whole thing, the whole thing, the whole thing Ohh my God
Baby, you done took this shit to another mother fucking level!
Now a neighborhood nigga like me ain't supposed to be getting no pussy like this
God damn, God damn!
Who taught you how to get sexy for a nigga?

You never used to talk dirty, but now you God damn disgusting!
My, my God, where'd you learn that?

Look at you mother fucking butt ass naked...
With them motherfucking Jimmy Choos on...
Who taught you how to put some motherfucking Jimmy Choos on?

Yo you took your pussy game up a whole 'nother level!

You done went all porno on a nigga, okay? And I, and I love it...
And I thank you, I thank you, my dick thanks you!
How did you learn, how... how did your pussy game come up?

I was fucking parts of your pussy I'd never fucked before!
I was in there like Oh, shit! I never been here before!
I've never even seen this part of pussy town before!
It's like you got this shit re-upholstered or some shit. What the fuck happened?
Who, who the fuck got your pussy all re-upholstered?

You know what, I got to thank Yeezy. And when I see that nigga, I'mma thank him. I'mma buy the album, I'mma download that motherfucker, I'm-a shoot a bootlegger!
That's how good I feel about this nigga
Oww, I still can't believe you got me this watch!
This motherfucker is the exact motherfucker I wanted!
Even with the bezel! This is the motherfucker I wanted!
I saw this shit, I saw it, Twista had this shit on in The Source!
I remember, Twista had this motherfucker on in The Source!
That's right, that's right! Yo yo babe, yo yo this is the best birthday ever!
Where'd you learn to treat a nigga like this?

Yeezy taught you well, Yeezy taught you wellYou're a barbarian, a savage I'm a barbarian, a savage, fully and semi automatic
A mannish hustler with the package, rock like Lenny Kravitz
On a mission about my mail, peddlin' chickens, Burney's and 12's
Rob a nigga if I have to, if all else fails
But that ain't really my get-down plus I know the laws of nature
It might not come back on me now but this will come back on me later
I'm from it, built for battle, the Bay made me a beast
Same Levis for weeks - 501's, no crease
I pack a cannon, .44 like Clint Eastwood you see
A cannon? Yeah but not the Canon camera 7D
I'm whiskey off this Landy
I don't know when I'll be sober again
I'm just now falling down from the sky
Finally coming down off my high
If it wasn't for the water the rap game would be dry
So I feed the soil life, resuscitate the game
Breathe life back into every real nigga that we lost, mane Uh, he an animal, a beast
He don't eat, nigga he feast
Same jeans for weeks
Out here with the zombies, fiends and tweaks Do the development while I might better tetch it don't wanna get caught loose
Some of these niggas act ill when they get on pills and courage juice
A lot of these dudes ain't real, lot of these cats are synthetic
Swervo, counterfeit, yeah nigga I said it
I just scribble on top of suckers up on my solid-dude list
I don't need no liabilities, I can't be taking no risks
Gotta say I found, go hard like them Marion Barbarians
When there's beef can't be no vegan or vegetarian
In the streets of Calif-harm-ia don’t let the palm trees mislead ya
Come out here with that tough guy attitude and we'll bleed you
Every time I look around I hear the streets blocked up
It's just like where you say send ya back in a pine box
I take my shirt off in this bitch, stretch marks and all
Turn into something, put my back against the wall
Get to jacking and punching until I break a nigga jaw
Keep swinging and swinging until my enemy fall
Biatch! He an animal, a beast
He don't eat, nigga he feast
Same jeans for weeks
Out here with the zombies, fiends and tweaks Mommy and daddy never home so we raised ourselves
No dental plan, medical insurance and health
So I'm out here with the zombies, dope fiends and tweaks
Bodies in the streets covered with sheets
Unlicensed drunk drivers, sex offenders in prides
Supposed to be saved folks, sinners and backsliders
It ain't for play, one thing about Los Angeles, San Diego and The Bay
We quick to throw it all away in one day
Over some he-say, she-say
Lock me up and throw the key away, give me L-I-F-E
Give a fuck, I'ma die out here became my mentality
Be a barbarian till I'm old and grey for eternity
Ghetto celebrity, hey, specializing in selling D
But right now it's a drought, so I'm selling tree
Zips, zaps, zubbles, peas for three
Thou-wow a pound, nigga holla at me
Biatch! He an animal, a beast
He don't eat, nigga he feast
Same jeans for weeks
Out here with the zombies, fiends and tweaks

On the way to the bank

Fuck all night, take percs by the cases
Get so high, I don't hear what she sayin
Somethin' 'boutta moon sign, somethin' 'bout a leo

She'll only cheat on me if you speak creo
Lost in Miami, gotta find her like nemo

Plots that don’t twist
I walk the blocks like whatever god, my message to y'all feds
Who desperate to arrest us young, benevolent hardheads
Abercrombie & Fitch rockin', wrist glistenin' marksman
Hitchcock of Hip-Hop since Big Pop departed
The project logic is still salute the dead, Glocks spit
Pour some juice out for those in Manchester, Beaumount
Otisville, Lewisberg, Fort Dix, Fort Worth, Oakdale
Every fed jail where all my dawgs lurk
War hurts much to gain 'til the day we all say
May your pain be champagne then we all blaze away
At our enemies, may they die easily
Long as they perish forever's what freedom means to me
Blowin' greenery, growing eager to see evil things
Thrown away, zonin' grey, GT, Diesel jeans
Airs and Chucks, solitaires, stones with the rarest cuts
On some Pretty Tone shit, haircut looks airbrushed
And they're aware of us though
And we don't give a flyin' 747 fuck though
Stayin' on my hus-tle *beat change* A message to those who trapped us up
From federal guys who backed them up
We never will die, we black and tough
Lead in your eye, we strapped to bust
Half of us been locked up inside the beast
Look at the time we see
Brooklyn to Compton streets, Queens
Even the Congo needs dreams
Our bullets and triggers our enemies
Pullin' on innocent women and children
It wasn't no ghetto killers
Who mixed up the coke and put guns in our buildings
But I'm not gon' cry and I'm not gon'
Just stand and watch you die
I'mma pass you a .9, I'mma grab your hand
Come on let's ride
A message to those who killed the king
Who murdered the Christ, the same regime
What God has built you never can break
What God has loved you never can hate
Man makes rules and laws
You just a ruthless dog, your kennel is waiting
You devils will run back into the caves you came from
Whenever that day comes, forty-acres
Plantations, see every race won
Sincerely yours, Street's Disciple, revelations

Then we had to have that terrible confrontation
There's nothing I can do to help this situation... Stay scheming 
Niggas wanna get at me

Niggas stunt on you, front on you
Niggas can't even ball but bunt on you, them niggas lame
I hope you get testicular cancer in the brain, dickhead
By the time you get that
I be somewhere with a six pack and a six pack
Her lips and her hips thick
My boxers are covered in her lipstick
Her pussy fat but ain't good, so that's a misprint
I'm a misfit, I did it and beyond
Shiny watch look like the old Diddy on my arm
Highly flammable, barely keep getting in Canada
Run this rap shit, I got stamina
You an amateur, I aim at 'cha, I bang at 'cha, hope a plane hit 'cha
Fuck you and whoever came witcha
Trying to express the beautiful pain witcha
Like a tattoo of a framed picture
Of a dead homie, maybe a family member
I got some gambling scriputres like um Scared money don't make no money
Bet now motherfucker gonna take them from me
Got ounces of loud you can hear me smoking
I be coughing on the crowd you can hear me choking nigga Oh I feel so fly
Came so far, but I still wanna fly
So come on in this car, this yacht, this plane
See what this beautiful pain, provide
Baby look into my eyes Shamon.. hm-mmm
You talk about hurting try washing clothes with no detergent
Daddy deserted so now we syrup sandwich serving
Dreaming we had a furnace so cold sleeping on the curtains
What can I say it got me highly motivated, mama two job working
But now the companies are merging
Need a two week notice before they say don't need your service
I'm too young to have burdens, but still feel I should be further
But who I'm I kidding I had bridges but I just burned them
My mama need earnings, ain't had no time I had learning
Call me a hypocrite, backslider, you name it I done heard it
The way they speak of me you think I'm already murdered
It's hard to be laid back, my haters so assertive, but
I gave my life up, I gave my rights up
I gave my dice up and I gave my dykes up
I gave my vice up and every club that lights up
And this is were the intern with no perm lights up You don't see my pain
I guess it's beautiful pain
It gotta be beautiful pain
Sometime you don't gotta say much Life is a game of inches
Every move leads to something better
There is no time to play the benches
Gotta get in the game and live forever, and ever I'll be the man or I rather die  Word on road is the clique about to blow
You ain't gotta run and tell nobody they already know

Now y'all just prayin You was a vic in high school now you a thug
Better step in the name of love
Before you giving pain a hug
Needing dope is like pain to drugs
Or aiming slugs til the game unplugged
Like a scoreboard with vice and warlords
Hot merchandise prices they want more for it
You was pink as ice single need to think it twice
Over the bitch and you came out like freaks in the night
Freed your mind at a cheaper price on the street trying to seek advice

Middle America packed in

Number one question they're askin'
Fuck every question you askin' 
If I don't get ran out by Catholics

My first brick did it
I knew I was addicted when I flipped it to four
Then I whipped it to more
And it's like the streets call you:
How could you leave me after all I done for you?
Who else would employ you? I made you feel royal
All it took was some oil, some water
Some baking soda to make you Hova
My first taste of power, I'm numb off the feeling
I'm done off, niggas, I can't stop dealing I'm addicted to the game
The shit keeps calling my name
I need to shoot Ain't you afraid to go to jail? God
Well use your brain, are you sane?
But like Dale Earnhardt, the game is racing through my veins
And I crash every time, but like I never hit the wall
I need the K's like Pedro so I'm back pitching raw
And when the bases are loaded and cops try to squeeze play
The game ain't cold enough to ever freeze Jay
And I, need the green like fiends need yay'
And they, say it ain't right but it's the game of life I'm addicted to the game
The shit keeps calling my name
I need to shoot I rap now, I eat good
I smoke good, drink good
Multi-millionaire but still I think hood
Belly full, I can't shake it
The hunger in my belly has been replaced with other forms of starvation
I guess it's just the need to be heard
I need niggas to say, I can't believe ya words
I'm just an addict, addicted to music
Thoughts is sporadic, I gotta unconfuse it
Sort of like a Rubik's Cube is
Every album's a color, but I fuck up the other, color
Ha, I guess I'm more like
A bitch with a belly but her ass is right, haha
Y'all don't understand me still
I'll never enjoy my success but my family will
And I'm alright with that
So the rap Jerry Rice is back
To fulfill the need, though I lead the league
I pray everyday, I travel at God's Speed
Not a minute slower 'cause the minute you Hova
Everybody's praying for your spinach to slow up
It's sad but it's true, but niggas ass gon' turn blue
Holding your breath 'cause the force that's controlling my step
Won't let me lose it, 'til I'm undisputed
Until I'm one with the music
'Til I'm dead and gone, in search of the perfect song, mon mon I'm addicted to the game
The shit keeps calling my name

What color was the skin of the man who beared the cross?
No matter how many lashes, they couldn't beat it off
How many Cassius' will we see in one lifetime?
That's why it's Miles Davis, Kobe, it's Mike time
I keep that GOAT book on the ottoman
And wrote hooks about slaves that was slaughtered in
The 1800s, y'all forget that
I got called nigga on Twitter so many times, yo, I lived that
Now I'm just tryna find where to raise my kids at
'Cause they don't want niggas next to where they crib at
Hey, realtor, I'm lookin' for a nice park
Twelve noon, she said my family gon' make it too dark
This is the flow that solar eclipses
So hopefully one day that real soul will eclipse
The bullshit they got us listenin' to, in this existence
Don't give up now, just a little more persistence
I am the day Ice Cube met Michael Jackson
Keep him away, huh? Something might happen
This is the makin' of a masterpiece
So we broke out the chains and told the master, Peace! My chain heavy, yeah, yeah, my chain heavy
My chain heavy, my chain too heavy
My chain heavy, yeah, yeah, my chain heavy
My chain heavy, my chain too heavy Here we go, like we should
Feel the sweat, on your face
Here we go, like we should
Feel the sweat, on your face
Alright, okay
Here we go, like we should
Like we should, like we should
Like we should Some wear a suit and tie, they don't wanna remain average
Some wear a suit and tie like a chain and a straitjacket
My chain heavy, stop in that traffic, coppers harass us
Then DA attack us, want us in chains like B.A. Baracus
So no major factor in my decision to be a rapper
Was rebellion; being anti-establishment was attractive
To a black kid from Brooklyn, flames got the thangs cooking
Land of the juks where them lames get them chains tooken
It ain't lookin' good for you if you're a tourist here
Sometimes I rhymes the sort of frequency that only purists hear
A couple rappers tried to beef with me, nobody's scared
Niggas was so fucking corny that nobody cared
Why I gotta battle rappers? I debate scholars
Question: do it gotta make sense if it make dollars?
Sick visions is living inside of brains
It's like we sadomasochistic, addicted to whips and chains
Figuratively, quite literally, clinically insane
Spit flames and then visit the higher plane
Try in vain to ignore it, don't buy the chain if you can't afford it
'Ye, them lonely-idled whores by the boards, trust That old ball-and-chain had me chained up for weeks
So of course I'm off the chain as soon as I hit the streets
And now when we link she saying the game's over
I drove her crazy and she became a chain smoker
Now the new dude she's saying that can stay over
Should be a chain, who goes by the name of Choker
That's what he did when she told him he should play the sofa
So the chains on the door, I'm on the way over
Now when I came over, his only response
Was, You must be the owner of a chain of restaurants
'Cause I'mma eat your food for that chain that I wore
'Cause you be running 'round like the chain make the man
So it's obvious the he don't know the chain of command
'Cause my chain commands, that kind of respect
And it's so chunky that it's a pain in the neck
But it came with a check, I remember on chaining day
It spoke for itself and this is what the chain would say
Them chain snatchers are hoping that you ain't ready
So don't get distracted, keep your aim steady
Or there'll be a chain reaction since my chain's heavy My chain heavy, yeah, yeah, my chain heavy
My chain heavy, my chain too heavy
My chain heavy, yeah, yeah, my chain heavy
My chain heavy, my chain too heavy Here we go, like we should
Feel the sweat, on your face
Here we go, like we should
Feel the sweat, on your face
Alright, okay
Here we go, like we should
Like we should, like we should
Like we should

Somebody tell me, what can I do?
(Cause their ain't enough bars
To hold the the drama that we've been through) Right here, right now, I do declare
That I'm more than a gangster, mack, pimp or a player
I swear I ain't never told on nobody
It started in '82 at a 'hood house party
Half Ded, Lil' Loc and my nephew D
Not knowin' what we do, but this is RTC
Heart sparked, puttin' flags in Tucane Park
I leave the house for school, but I come back after dark
You feel me? More power, more leadership - unifying Bloods and Crips
I used to smoke a pack a day, I used to have to pack a K
Now I've got brothers in suits in my faculty
Pushin' peace in the streets - North, West, South and East
Student of the game, yeah it's time to make a change
So I'm following, no more swine swallowin'
I'm gon' just walk the walk of a righteous man
Try my best to rewrite this plan
As-salamu alaykum, sir
Yeah, that's the plan... Yeah, I'm down with Obama just to add a little drama
And I'm rollin' with the Nation, but I've been doin' that
Had a talk with my mama, had to let her know that I'mma
Make a change, and she said: baby, go ahead and do that
Farrakhan is a prophet and I know it cause he show it
And he told me, so I'm teachin' brothers how to be peace
What's wrong? We too strong, and if we all get along
They could never penetrate us, all they do is motivate us
Haters... The enemy is always watching for leadership that will rise among black people because it is only by organizing effectively that you can change the reality under which we live 
Can I, baby? Can I, baby?
Can I, baby? Can I, baby? Can I? Bring you to the six where I really stay, Baby?
Show you why I am the way I am
Can I tell you what I think my biggest flaw is, Baby?
I try to be consistent, but I can't
Can I have an honest moment wit' you right now, Baby?
Tell me who the fuck you want to be
Can I get an honest answer from you right now, Baby?
Cause all we ever talk about is me
Can I? Before I turn the lights out, one more time
'Fore I turn the lights out, tell me who the fuck you want to be
Can I? call instead of text you on the hotline?
Sometimes a nigga wanna hear your voice
Can I? see you right now, I know the sun is up, Baby?
Sorry, I don't really have a choice
Can I? ever make you feel like I'm down for you, Baby?
You do so much more than that for me
Can I? finally take the time and open up to you, Baby?
Cause that's the side you never get to see
Can I? Before I turn the lights out, one more time
'Fore I turn the lights out, tell me who the fuck you want to be Can I, baby? Can I, baby?
Can I, baby? Can I, baby?
Can I, baby? Can I, baby?

I'm not tryna find nobody else to beat
I'm the one they come to see because they all
Believe me Yea, rip, rip, rip
It's been me and Young Tune off the rip
That's the man that put me in this shit
If a nigga fuck with him, I'll put him down quick
Got a verse for anybody wanna talk about the clique
I've been takin' shit light, you don't wanna hear me trip
God damn, do y'all really know who you fuckin' with?
Yeah, I mean you can't blame me for wonderin'
Doesn't matter, could be winter or the summer
On the road, I do One Direction numbers, I don't fuckin' miss
Yeah, Stunna and Mack know
When Wayne was gone for eight months, we put this thing up on our back
And I was snappin' off on every single track though
Collect call from the boss like where we at though
I was like, Hah, it's our time, nigga
He left Rikers in a Phantom, that's my nigga
And I've been rockin' with the team, Tha Carter IX
And we YMCMB, waitin' on somebody to try us, nigga
Yeah Lord knows I'll murder one of these niggas, yeah
Uh, His and hers Ferraris, nigga
One for me, one for my daughter, nigga
Waitin' for someone to test me like a Harvard nigga
I told her 2-23, two Michael Jordans, nigga
Come on, fight these shell cases like a lawyer, nigga
Find out where you stay, and act like we found some oil, nigga
Out of duct tape so when he prayin', I ignore the nigga
All I gotta say is sayonara, nigga
Drop dead gorgeous but the bitch ain't dyin' for a nigga
Where the real queens at? Shout out Capone and Noreaga
We can shoot it out and see who live to tell the story later
Diamonds in my Rollie face, cannot be exfoliated
They think I'm associated, I'm the one that orchestrated
Yayo get her ass whipped, whip that ass like horses racin'
Ain't 'bout what you walk away from, it's 'bout what you walk away with
Dead Presidents, them coffins vacant, I must be doin' somethin' Had to get it poppin' off the rip
Rich young nigga that ain't never had to trick
Slim Thug flow but you know I like 'em thick
If she get a job at DOA, I drop her off a tip
I had to get it poppin' off the rip
I'm the one they tell ya been reppin' in the 6
Come into the city and ya niggas get to trippin'?
We'll take ya to the Scarborough Bluff and drop you off a cliff
Well damn... just be happy for the man
Nirvana, Coldplay nigga got bands
Ink from the money got it all over my hands
Goin' out to Houston spendin' all of my advance
V Live just took me for a cheque
Drake you know I love you, you just took me outta debt
Yes right now you are lookin' at the best
Mothafuck award shows and mothafuck the press like that! Mothafuck the rest
When they jumped off the porch, I was stumblin' up the steps
I'd give what I collect before I give up my connect
It'd be a cold day in Hell, icicles made of sweat
One finger... slidin' 'cross my neck
Niggas know what that mean like they deaf
Nigga I'll fire this nina like it's her first day
On the job and the bitch overslept
Tune stay humble, nigga I'm a king
Need a horn and a drumroll
They throw mothafuckin' roses at my feet, nigga
I don't step on one rose
I'm the only one that get the job done
I don't know a nigga that can cover for me
Tape a couple kilos to the bitch stomach
She look like she got a bun in the oven from me
Preheat... believe me
All you gotta do is pay me every week
I had these bitches havin' babies every week
I'm the nigga, see me skatin' in the streets
Gone
You'll live, and you'll learn
See 'cause you've never been the same as anyone else
Don't think the same as everyone else
You'll love, and you'll learn
See you'll never conclude with anyone else
Don't think the same as everyone else If I had everything, everything
I could change anything
If I changed anything, I mean anything
I would change everything, oh yeah Dark boy, don't you cry
There's too much life left in those eyes
Don't you let that face go waterfall
Don't you learn to love your scars and all?
Dark boy, don't you die
They're just human, let them lie
You just know your world and speak your truth
Let them come to you
For you'll love, in your heart
See 'cause you've never been the same as anyone else
Don't think the same as everyone else
This is your call, there are no wrongs
See you'll never conclude with anyone else
Don't think the same as everyone else If I had everything, everything
I could change anything, I could change anything
If I changed anything, I mean anything
I would change everything, oh yeah When the media slings mud, we use it to build huts
Irrefutable facts, merciful, beautiful black beloved brother
You fail to embarrass him, harassin' him
To my life, your life pales in comparison
So go write whatever blog, messiness is not ever the God
Do what's necessary, I'm never worried
Listen vultures, I've been shackled by Western culture
You convinced most of my people to live off emotion
That's why we competin', death by the chrome barrel
Forgot the secrets, my Kilimanjaro bone marrow's the deepest
You can peep at the comments, but don't fall for that
We want freedom, I'm a scholar; an almanac
People do anything to be involved in everything
Inclusion is a hell of a drug
Some people have everything they probably ever wanted in life
And never have enough If I had everything, everything
I could change anything
If I changed anything, I mean anything
I would change everything, oh yeah From the birth of a child, the world is foul
Excursions of a searchin' child
Should learn to take nothin' personal
A parent hates to watch his baby's face
Takin' his first immunization shots, but this is great
The child's introduction to suffering and pain
Understands without words, nothin' is explained
Or rushed to the brain, lookin' up at his parents' face
Like, I thought you would protect me from this scary place?
Why'd you let them inject me?
Who's gonna know how these side effects is gonna affect me?
Who knew I would grow to meet presidents that respect me?
If Starbucks is bought by Nestlé, please don't arrest me
I need to use your restroom and I ain't buy no espresso
Soon enough, assume the cuffs, the position
Not new to us, since back on the bus sittin'
Said, Screw that bus! – boycotted that bus outta business
The future's us, yet every citizen's in prison If I had everything, everything
I could change anything
If I changed anything, I mean anything
I would change everything, oh yeah Watch me as I walk through the folly, golly, New York to Saudi
In Italy, I'm Eduardo Wiccari
But Nasty the hustler, nasty like mustard gas, sulfur
And I could sell Alaska to Russia, no pressure
My first house, 11,000-square-feet mansion
It was a haunted by dead rich whites
Mad a nigga bought his crib to hang up pictures of black Christ
Circular driveways, black cars and black ice
My second house, still in my twenties, illin' with money
Chilled through my spine, spillin' wine, it's funny
Did good for a staircase loiterer, euphoria
What you saw when you seen a teen turn to a warrior
Did every Fourth of July, bustin' in the sky
It was important to a guy who was mob-minded
Future Murciélago driver 'til Lambos got average on me
I started likin' the look like I ain't had no money
Yellow taxi seats over Maybach seats
Just to remind me, just to inspire me
To stay focused, it's a real sick society
Just 'cause I got your support don't mean you're buyin' me
I'm buyin' back the land owned by the slave masters
Where my ancestors lived, just to say a rapper
Made a change, the pants-sagger put plans in action
To lay claim the Pan-African made it happen You'll live, and you'll learn
See 'cause you've never been the same anyone else
Don't think the same as everyone else
You'll live, and you'll learn
See you'll never conclude with anyone else
Don't think the same as everyone else If I had everything, everything
I could change anything
If I changed anything, I mean anything
I would change everything, oh yeah Dark boy, don't you cry
There's too much life left in those eyes
Don't you let that face go waterfall
Don't you learn to love your scars and all
Dark boy, don't you die
They're just human, let them lie
You just know your world and speak your truth
And let them come to you
For you'll love, in your heart
See 'cause you've never been the same as anyone else
Don't think the same as everyone else
This is your call, there are no wrongs
See you'll never conclude with anyone else
Don't think the same as everyone else

Loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
Cocaine quarter piece, got war and peace inside my DNA
I got power, poison, pain and joy inside my DNA
I got hustle though, ambition flow inside my DNA
I was born like this, since one like this, immaculate conception
I transform like this, perform like this, was Yeshua new weapon
I don't contemplate, I meditate, then off your fucking head
This that put-the-kids-to-bed
This that I got, I got, I got, I got—
Realness, I just kill shit ’cause it's in my DNA
I got millions, I got riches buildin' in my DNA
I got dark, I got evil, that rot inside my DNA
I got off, I got troublesome heart inside my DNA
I just win again, then win again like Wimbledon, I serve
Yeah, that’s him again, the sound that engine in is like a bird
You see fireworks and Corvette tire skrrt the boulevard
I know how you work, I know just who you are
See, you's a, you's a, you's a—
Bitch, your hormones prolly switch inside your DNA
Problem is, all that sucker shit inside your DNA

Shit I've been through prolly offend you, this is Paula's oldest son
I know murder, conviction
Burners, boosters, burglars, ballers, dead, redemption
Scholars, fathers dead with kids and
I wish I was fed forgiveness
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, soldier’s DNA 
Born inside the beast, my expertise checked out in second grade
When I was 9, on cell, motel, we didn't have nowhere to stay
At 29, I’ve done so well, hit cartwheel in my estate
And I'm gon' shine like I'm supposed to, antisocial extrovert
And excellent mean the extra work
And absentness what the fuck you heard
And pessimists never struck my nerve
And Nazareth gon’ plead his case
The reason my power's here on earth
Salute the truth, when the prophet say I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
This is why I say that hip hop has done more damage to young African Americans than racism in recent years
I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
I live a better life, I'm rollin' several dice, fuck your life
I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
I live a be-, fuck your life
5, 4, 3, 2, 1
This is my heritage, all I'm inheritin'
Money and power, the maker of marriages Tell me somethin'
You mothafuckas can't tell me nothin'
I'd rather die than to listen to you
My DNA not for imitation
Your DNA an abomination
This how it is when you in the Matrix
Dodgin' bullets, reapin' what you sow
And stackin' up the footage, livin' on the go
And sleepin' in a villa
Sippin' from a Grammy, walkin' in the buildin'
Diamond in the ceilin', marble on the floors
Beach inside the window, peekin' out the window
Baby in the pool, godfather goals
Only Lord knows I've been goin' hammer
Dodgin' paparazzi, freakin' through the cameras
Eat at Four Daughters, Brock wearin' sandals
Yoga on a Monday, stretchin' to Nirvana
Watchin' all the snakes, curvin' all the fakes
Phone never on, I don't conversate
I don't compromise, I just penetrate
Sex, money, murder—these are the breaks
These are the times, level number 9
Look up in the sky, 10 is on the way
Sentence on the way, killings on the way
Motherfucker, I got winners on the way
You ain't shit without a body on your belt
You ain't shit without a ticket on your plate
You ain't sick enough to pull it on yourself
You ain't rich enough to hit the lot and skate
Tell me when destruction gonna be my fate
Gonna be your fate, gonna be our faith
Peace to the world, let it rotate
Sex, money, murder—our DNA 
Ayo, it’s Weezy motherfuckin', easy with the hatin'
Bitch, I’m in the buildin', you just decoratin'

Weezy spit snowballs, catch it in your face bitch
Good game, Wayne, man, I deserve a Naismith
Cocaine gang flow, dope in the vein flow
I'll only be smoking the purple out the rainbow
Stronger than Drano, your boyfriend a lame-o
And if you stay with him, then y’all in the same boat
Deepwater Carter, fishing for a dollar
You can join the salad, I’m splitting your tomata
Ball 'cause I gotta, you’ll love me in the morning
I told her I'm a King, them other niggas Prince Charming

Man, I'm in love with her grill, George Foreman
Forewarning, Young Money’s armed
And we can shoot it out, I got the money drawn
Yeah, take that to the bank wit' ya
I rock my hat to the side like I paint pictures
Smoke weed, talk shit like Lane Kiffin
Whole country in recession, but Wayne different
And I’m a Maybach rider
Haven’t drove it one time, I got a cool black driver
Can't walk around with guns, I got a dude that got 'em
Don’t worry if I'm shootin' as long as you don't get shot
And I'm a beast, I'm a pit bull

I'm a beast, I'm a big bull
I got my money right, I got my clip full
Yeah, it’s like seven in the morning, nigga

Stop the track, let me relish in the moment, nigga
Now bring that motherfucker back, 'cause I’m goin' in, nigga
I go hard like Rafael Nadal
And if the bitches worth having then I bet we have 'em all
And man, I'm so high, it's like an everlasting fall
And I’m charging these hoes like women basketball
Uh, I bet that chopper get his mind right
Leave a hole in his chest like a lion bite
Superhero car, like I crime fight
I see big cheese, you niggas' blind mice
Uh, T-Streets still roll with me
Still sticking to the script, like Nicole Kidman
Need the man hit? We are those hitmen
He stopped running, the bullet holes didn’t
Uh, basically, I’m still a monster
'Til the fat lady sing, I come to kill a opera
Y'all too plain, I'm a helicopter
My words keep going, like a teleprompter
I’m a asshole, wipe me down, bitch
I get big checks, Niketown, bitch
Yeah, mean mug, Bobby Brown shit
And the flag red, like clown lips

What you think you like me? You ain't like me motherfucker
You a punk, I been with made people, connected people
Who you been with? Chain snatchin', jive-ass, maricon motherfuckers
Why don't you go get lost
Get out of here, go kick a freestyle or somethin' You're now tuned into the greatest
Motherfuckers can't beat us, join us, can't fade us, hate us
Can't touch it, fuck it, can't see 'em, try to be 'em
Both shows sold out your coliseum, 8th Wonder
Locked rap for three summers, poker faces with the aces under
Phase one of the takeover, the break's over
Nigga, I'm the God MC, me, Jay-Hovah
Shit knockin', almost a crime, get Cochran
Bangin' to the hearse where my doctors hand
Hot land, FBI, DEA, I did crime, got away
They wanna see me pay, motherfuckers better ride
If they try to plant, under the seat of my car
Even a half a gram, better flame those, plainclothes
Same goes for lame hoes, cocaine rapper
Rep ya game pros We celebrate this, while you sittin' back screamin' you hate this
Try to rape this, get caught in my crime matrix
Spittin' sperm inside of latex
You get, no respect like a child rapist
Delegate this, men just givin' face lifts
Leave your melon spacious, career felon, no hiatus
Nor Caesar's, the CIA flooded my block with diseases
Informants, heatin' the spot up like global warmin'
Who start *shit*? My style is laced with arsenic
Odorless tasteless, cause of death is traceless
I know you wanna see me wasted
You call the order, I'll be in Hell
Team Roc sweater and ice water
Righteous, dominate the global, my life's a novel
Blazin in Barnes and Noble, idolize the vocals
Y'all niggas is local but that's evident
I'm Resident Evil, movin' like  Millionaire that flow like water, rap *niggas* runnin'
I, oughta applaud ya, clap at ya
Point the MAC at ya, *niggas* caught up
Brought up in the rapture, my flows torture
Like a compound fracture, can't *fuck* widdit
For the love of sex money and drugs
Affiliated with the sets, TECs, honies and thugs
Let the four power, rain on niggas like a spring shower
And bring flowers for the bodies that surround us
If you was lookin' you found us
Movin' with speed, tried to play Superman
Ended up like Chris Reeves
Paraplegic, precise minds like the Pharaohs of Egypt
Shot through a barrel niggas narrowly weaved it
Keepin' my Team top seeded with the Sweet 16's
Bulgin' out of my jeans, on the ten-speed weeded
Holdin', share these shots with you like a secret
It's like a story never told, but believe it... Street anthem anchor, quick to trade shots just like a banker
Lick a round, niggas hit the ground like Sanka
I got ya screwface in forty-two ways
Aim better than toothpaste, Jerry Maguire
Show Me The Money like Clue tapes
Run up in your spot with a few eights, zonin'
Known men, home in, all of my homies condone sin
Four shots spin ya like chrome rims
Put a part right through your dome like the Omen, foamin'
White sheets got ya wrapped like a Roman
Back in New York, honey wants it, just spit blood and talk funny
*Niggas* is cartoons, picture styles that's fully developed
Like dark rooms, hits fat, cub with a harpoon
Heat-seekin', grill huntin', still frontin'?
Keep squeezin', *fuck it*, I leave the whole street wheezin'
No *motherfuckers* hope I fail, and gotta provoke the frail
Got 'em scared to drop like soap in jail Geah, there you have it
Just think of ours as can't be touched, tested, whatever
Never disrespect this thing of ours

When I flow for the street.. - .. who else could it be
Nas.. Yo, explode, my thoughts were drunken from quarts of beers
Was years back, before Nasir would explore a career in rap
As a music dude, I mastered this Rubik's Cube
Godzilla, fought Gargantua, eyes glued to the tube
Was a, long time ago, John Boy Ice
Geronimo po-lice jumpin' out Chryslers, e-z wider paper
Pops puffin' his cess, punchin' his chest like a gorilla
Outside was psychoes, killers
Saw Divine, Goon, and Chongo, Lil' Turkey
R.I.P. Tyrone, 'member no cursin front of Ms. Vercey
Big Percy, Crazy Paul, the Sledge Sisters
My building was 40-16, once in the blue, hallways was clean
I knew, all that I'd seen had meant somethin'
Learned early, to fear none little Nas was huntin'
Livin carefree laughin', got jokes on the daily
Y'all actin' like some old folks y'all don't hear me
Yo, I'm in my second childhood When I flow for the street.. - .. who else could it be
N-A-S - Nas..
Resurrect, through the birth of my seed.. - Queensbridge
Make everything right.. - Get yours, nigga
When I flow for the street.. - .. who else could it be
N-A-S - Nas..
Resurrect, through the birth of my seed.. - Queensbridge
Make everything right.. - Get yours... Yo, dude is 31, livin' in his moms crib
Ex-convict, was paroled there after his long bid
Cornrows in his hair, still slingin', got a crew
They break his moms furniture, watchin' Comicview
Got babies by different ladies high smokin' L's
In the same spot he stood since eighty-five, well
When his stash slow, he be crazy
Say he by his moms, hit her on her payday
Junior high school dropout, teachers never cared
They was paid just to show up and leave, no one succeeds
So he moves with his peers, different blocks, different years
Sittin' on, different benches like it's musical chairs
All his peoples moved on in life, he's on the corners at night
With young dudes it's them he wanna be like
It's sad but it's fun to him, right? He never grew up
31 and can't give his youth up, he's in his second childhood When I flow for the street.. - .. who else could it be
N-A-S - Nas..
Resurrect, through the birth of my seed.. - Queensbridge
Make everything right.. - Get yours, nigga
When I flow for the street.. - .. who else could it be
N-A-S - Nas..
Resurrect, through the birth of my seed.. - Queensbridge
Make everything right.. - Get yours... Baby girl she's always talkin', name droppin', hangin' late
Drinkin', smokin', hates her baby daddy, craves shoppin'
E poppin' Ecstasy takin', won't finish her education
Best friend she keeps changin', stuck with limitations
Lustin' men, many hotels, Fendi, Chanel
With nothin' in her bank account frontin' she do well
Her kid suffers he don't get that love he deserve
He the Sun, she the Earth, single mom, even worse
No job never stay workin', mad purty
Shorty they call her the brain surgeon
Time flyin', she the same person
Never matures, all her friends married doin' well
She's in the streets yakkety yakkin' like she was 12
Honey is twenty-seven, argues fights
Selfish in her own right for life
Guess she's in her second childhood When I flow for the street.. - .. who else could it be
N-A-S - Nas..
Resurrect, through the birth of my seed.. - Queensbridge
Make everything right.. - Get yours, nigga
When I flow for the street.. - .. who else could it be
N-A-S - Nas..
Resurrect, through the birth of my seed.. - Queensbridge
Make everything right.. - Get yours... Who else could it be.. - N-A-S - Nas, Nas..

Nothing in this world can refresh your soul like being home
But a lot of niggas done sold they souls and made the wrong decision
So they can't come back home
So they try to find another source but it ain't nothing like love from the streets
I cherish these motherfuckin streetsKendrick: Got me breathing with dragons
I crack the egg on you bastard
Why you step to the master

Then him second, then you third
Nouns, my verbs
Battle these words

I'm really doin' it
Nigga I be doin' this
Nigga I come through with this

Nigga I'm a student and I peeped the way you did it
Now I'm bout to do it off of the top of the fuckin' tip Kendrick: If you bout to do off of the top, then fucking did it
If you say that you the best, then nigga won't you admit it
I see you got the waves in your hair i been there
Back in 8th grade, when the pussy i was scared
But now im seeing all kinds of woman in peripheral
This is individual, this here is a ritual
This here is spiritual
This is not rap , this is god body
Nigga this ain't nothing close to lyrical Troi Breeze: Shit all I'm sayin now is I agree with you
I been grownin' in it like I was a tree with you
Now I'm tryna do it like I was a seed and I grew up
And now I'm blessed like I just sneezed; hachew
I really appreciate it
I really appreciate you callin me up cause I'm out here and I'm ballin' it up
Taking the biggest shots, and now I been getting' it tryna spend the biggest knots
Cause I'm really out here tryna grind for my family
Tryna go off of that energy, I know you feel my inner G
My brotha was from Piru
My pops was from what's he was raised out on Grape Street Kendrick: Well if ya brother was from Piru and your partna was from Watts
Then you should already know about them Compton blocks
All my niggas that's with me is from the city
All my niggas hold choppas and they be with me

Big Havoc at like you know, kid Kid, you don't know me, you don't wanna know me
You tried to blow me your weak side just showed me
Stepped out my door on 41st Side at 12,
Didn't see my crew around so I got bent for search
I had to jet back upstairs so I can stash my 9
It was a Friday night Rikers had it bad one time
Cause niggas getting bagged on a regular son
D's like Fuck the drugs, all we want is the guns,
So I proceed with caution, eyes open whenever walking
Niggas be ass talking then be victims of extortion
Hold myself down the only way I know
Niggas pumping back in streets, in debt cause they owe
Street life is like a trial, ass out if you blow
The maximum is death son you know how that go
Yeah, Link Up TV, Behind Barz

Shoutout Giggs for settin' the ting
SN1, OVO

Been with Chubbs through highs and lows
We seen man last night, they froze
Wasn't no cameras, wasn't no pose
Just like that one time at 'Chella
Good thing man weren't pullin' out phones Staying in big six-six with woes
Man start dissin' and doin' reposts
They do anything except road
Still can't see them after it snows
I don't have time for the wasteman jokes
Personal ting if I'm gettin' up close
Loyal to O 'cause I've taken a oath
Versace hotel and I'm takin' the robes
Seen 'em in person, I'm seein' a ghost
They told me relax 'cause they're takin' control
Take all that shit up with P and his bro
I wish you the best, let me know how it goes
Wanna be free and I wanna let go
We came around and you showed us the most
I know so much shit that I cannot expose
I keep it inside and I laugh on my own
Got all the tea and I'm hottin' it up
I need a shade mansion, a room's not enough
You're droppin' some shit but that shit was a bust
They got no direction, they're followin' us
I come from a city that they never touch
Your man is a goofy and he could get rushed
I can't name a rapper or girl that I trust
I dream about turnin' these yutes into dust Yeah, yeah
Big Scorpion, out now
Yeah, look You know how the paigon chit-chat goes
I like Rs and Vs and Os
I don't really play no tic-tac-toe
Been with Roxx through highs and lows

Wasn't no cameras, wasn't no pose
Just like that one time at Nobu
Good thing man weren't pullin' out phones Think you know me? That's not true
We got ties in West End too
She came over and she got slewed
Throwin' up six like man had flu
I got way too big off Views
Back to the basics, I won't lose
They wanna link when they got no chunes
They too worried 'bout sellin' out shoes
I don't give a fuck about jeans and crep
Or goin' to Milan or goin' to the Met
I just wanna make these songs for the set
I just wanna load that and let that wet
I got so much tings in the stash
Fold up anyone, dun that clash
Got no sense like Jizzle and shh
Big and bad like leader and shh
Can't do love 'cause they get too attached
Phone get broke and whip get scratched
I'ma just take my knots in cash
They can never tie me down, that's facts
All that bark but we know he's a cat
I don't really like goin' tit for tat
I'ma just come like tat-tat-tat
I'ma just end that there, that's that Yeah, Link Up TV
Drizzy Drake
Maddas, jheeze!

Cuz' I ain't gotta think with a light bulb on
Nigga I eat, sleep, and shit rap; I never relax, been a busybody since I was born
Is he really fucking with Sean?
I reply, His pick, I would take a tool on.
Dolce brown nigga, I'm right now, you ain't gotta wait later
Where the CD at? Put it in the disc player
Tell ho ride to it, I do it like none other
Came back definition of a young motherfucker with a problem
Future of the West Coast I am
And that's real tough
Southern California, Angels, AKA LA's Chucks
Make comparisons when I seen him duck
Man you think What was to Pac and Big, before?
And that was before
I picked up a pen, and when I did, my thumb and my index sore
And then I started writing with it
Found that it flows better, like a Venice Beach sea shore
He don't wear the same clothes as ya'll
He is cut from a different cloth
Ya boy is cool, but I'm a different frost
Like igloo, every time I come off
Every time I take off
Pandemonium when I take off
They hanging on the wing of that G4
30,000 feet and still won't fall
Why you do that for?
Why you had to sell out that store
You made my record sales come up short
My reply is that it ain't my fault
Blame God I can't wait when its my time 
No I take that back, cuz' I got time 
I know that patience is virtue
But that being said, you can't time beef, or I'll hurt you
No lie 
No I take that back, cuz' I got time 
I know that patience is virtue
But that being said, you can't time beef, or I'll hurt you
No lie  When the lights get dark
And every body quiet, know its my part
I might start a riot
The main event
Bulletproof under that black tent, you can't shoot through shit
I never played the bench
Star Point Guard
Never pass up money, I'm a ball hog
Touch anything I get my hands on, into pushin' like Ray Charles
I never had no flaws
Ooos and Ahhs after every bar
Take your bitch, then give her back
For no reason for, just because, ya'll actin hard
I'm bein myself
And I got some plastic under my belt, so rest assured
You don't want your moms thinkin' bout pullin' that hospital cord
Went from a Honda Accord, to a Bentley Azure
Back seat got a flock of broads
And I ain't gotta say to kiss it, just like Sure
Momma gon' clean or fix it
Use Terrific, Easter Brum????????
All it need is a little season on
Who said a veteran can't be so young?
I sound better than half ya'll on
Damn K. Dot, let me see your arm
I ain't gotta do a show, my jewels perform
I ain't gotta do a show, my jewels perform
Princess cut looks stupid dumb
Eyes close shut, all I see is dollar signs
And I won't get enough till I'm layed in the grave or hand cuffed up bout one time
No Lie
Blame God I can't wait when its my time 
No I take that back, cuz' I got time 
I know that patience is virtue
But that being said, you can't time beef, or I'll hurt you
No lie 
No I take that back, cuz' I got time 
I know that patience is virtue
But that being said, you can't time beef, or I'll hurt you
No lie 
Met her in the Summer, later the fall of me
Yeah, such a bummer
I gave the bitch all of me
Met her in the summer, later the fall of me
And it's such a bummer
Cause I gave the bitch all of me I gave her my all, yeah, yeah
I showed her my flaws, yeah, yeah
Round of applause, you got me
But I still won, becuase you topped me in your back seat
In an all black cavalier, don't you remember, that December
Admit, lil bitch don't be scared
Don't you remember? You were my little sinner Met her in the Summer, later the fall of me
Yeah, such a bummer
I gave the bitch all of me
Met her in the summer, later the fall of me
And it's such a bummer
Cause I gave the bitch all of me I gave her all of me
I gave her all of me, physically, spiritually, oh
Fake Spiritual hoe
I gave her all of me
Mentally leavin' me cold, takin' love from my soul
Love Respect, in that order, I gave her all of me
Even walked across the water, I gave her all of me
Hopped the fences, crossin' borders
I gave her all of me, literally all of me Met her in the Summer, later the fall of me
Yeah, such a bummer
I gave the bitch all of me
Met her in the summer, later the fall of me
And it's such a bummer
Cause I gave the bitch all of me
So I had to memorize these rhymes until I got home
You understand? You know, once you memorize a sentence
It's like an exercise Y'all niggas can't be serious right now
I'm the all time heavyweight champion of flowers
I'm leading the league in at least six statistical categories right now:
Best flow, most consistent, realest stories
Most charisma, I set the most trends
And my interviews are hotter! Holla! I jog in the graveyard, spar in the same ring
That was housed by the building where Malcolm X was slain
I spring train in the winter, 'round early December
Run suicide drills over and over
With the weight of the world on my shoulder
That's why they call me Hova
I'm far from being God, but I work goddamn hard
I wake up the birds so when the nerds asleep
I'm catching my second wind the second the first one ends
I am focused, man, and I'm not afraid of death
And I'm going all out, I circle the vultures in a van and
I run the block 
Push up on my money 
I keep jacks jumping, thirty six sets
Like a personal trainer I teach coke to stretch
I pump in Roc sweats, all white trainers
The ghetto's Billy Blanks, I show you niggas what pain is
Maintain your stamina, Hov will damage ya
Spot you two rhymes, y'all niggas is amateurs
The fifth, a dead lift if niggas don't want to get shot
Then y'all niggas better squat, I drop your set for rep
No need to hit the showers, the spit from the fifth leave you wet
Lyrical exercise, y'all niggas ain't tired right? One  one
Two  two
Three  three
 four, breathe easy...
One  one
Two  two
Three  three
 four, breathe easy...
One  one
Two  two
Three  three
 four, breathe easy...
One, two, three, four, breathe easy Suckers, get your weight up, not your hate up
Jigga man is diesel when I lift the eight up
Y'all ain't ready to workout with the boy
Your flow is brain on drugs, mines is rap on steroids
I lift every voice when I sing, my ability
Make yours look like an exercise in futility
Bring your squad, biceps, triceps, and quads
We don't struggle with undeveloped muscles
Y'all ain't real, that's y'all Achilles' heel
Same routine when you see me you know the drill
I spot ya, I lift the weight of the watch
Off your arm, remain nice and calm
Put down your things, Trinidad of the game
Know my way around your ring
No matter how many pounds you bring
It sounds like the same old thing
R-O-C is the strongest team, fuckers One  one
Two  two
Three  three

One  one
Two  two

One, two, three, four, breathe easy
This here is on some truthful shit
It seems like everything I do, you're used to it
And I hate hearing stories 'bout who you've been with
That's when I gotta hide what I'm feeling inside
So you still think I'm confident, and damn
Is this gonna last?
You're up on a pedestal, are we moving too fast?
Feel like I'm in crazy competition with the past
That's why I gotta ask Is anything I'm doin' brand new?
Brand new , brand new
Is anything I'm doin' brand new?

Brand new , brand new, brand new, brand new
Oh, girl  This here is something personal
I highly doubt this feeling is reversible
Knowledge is pain and that is why it hurts to know
That you attempt to hide and put mistakes aside
So I don't ever question you, and damn
I can't even find the perfect brush
So I can paint what's going through my mind
Racing against myself, but I'm a couple steps behind
That's why I gotta ask Is anything I'm doin' brand new?
Brand new , brand new
Is anything I'm doin' brand new?

Brand new , brand new, brand new, brand new
Oh, girl 
Is anything I'm doin' brand new?
New, new, new, new, new
Or is everything I'm doing too late?
Late, late, late, late Did he take your clothes off just like this?
Did he give you loving just like this?
Did you spend the night in his bed on the very first date?
Tell me baby, am I too late? Is anything I'm doin' brand new?
Brand new , brand new
Show me if this is brand new 

New, new, new , oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

What's the best form of genocide?
Black-on-black crime
Cause I guess it takes up less of they time
What's the best form, best, best form of genocide?
Black-on-black crime
Cause I guess it takes up less time
Now, if you can make the niggas kill the other niggas, go figure
If you can make the niggas kill the other niggas, go figure
Then we'll have more time to make real figures
And we can still keep it lookin' at them like
Damn, look at those real niggas
With they chains and they cars, but they still niggas
Cause soon as a nigga gets it
Then another nigga wants to get it
Soon as another nigga has a girl
Then another nigga wants to hit it, admit it
Soon as a nigga has a crib
They want to break into that nigga crib
See where he live, see what he did
And don't wanna do the same shit he did to get that crib
Get it? You know, when niggas is killin' niggas
What's amazin' to me
What don't phase me is when niggas try to call me crazy
Cause they don't phase me
Cause I don't give a fuck what people think
Cause people don't think
See, I don't give a fuck what people think
Cause people just don't think
Now picture this; now if I show up onto this motherfucker
And express myself creatively
They always want to say, He's crazy, see
And when they so distressed
What would be the best thing to write?
How 'bout this: Kanye West wears a dress?
Yes, now maybe that can take away from the way
I kick them niggas ass on 12/12/12
Maybe that can take away
Nah, nah, nigga, they seen it, these niggas seen it theyself
Well, and my grandfather ninety-seven
He said, I ain't never seen you get down like that
He ain't give a fuck about the kilt, this dress
Whatever the fuck they call it
You see, niggas killin' niggas
You can't see through the fog
With all the negativity that they write on a blog
I give a fuck about what somebody think
If that person doesn't think
It's too early in the conversation anyway
You know, they say, You should be embarrassed
You should be embarrassed, you a nigga
How the fuck you gonna show your clothin' line in Paris?
You should be embarrassed, you should be
Didn't you read the reviews, the press?
I don't give a fuck, I guess
I don't give a fuck, no, it's not that I don't give a fuck
It's that I give most of the fuck and I'm not givin' up
And it's not that I'm crazy, no, that's a lie
I'm not crazy, I'm just not satisfied
And I would die for what I believe in
When I see that, uh, just a change what y'all receivin'
Do you all receive us? Do y'all believe it? It's too much
Okay, there's someone they can't touch
How 'bout some integrity from your favorite celebrity?
That's me, that's me, niggas killin' niggas
Why he do that? Why he wear that?
Why he say that? Where he play it?
Oh, my God, nigga, niggas
It's bad enough, it's hard enough
It's hard enough, it's hard enough, it's hard enough
It's hard enough, it's hard enough
But you can never say I didn't give my heart enough
And if we did somethin' good
And we didn't say, Oh, excuse me. Pardon us
Then they want to throw niggas back
On, on, on the retarded bus
And when they riot in the streets
They gon' say, What, what the fuck started us?
And made 'em start it up?
And look at me like I ain't smart enough
And everybody got a suggestion and a lesson
And a question and a stress
And then they always want to stress a man, uh
And say, Maybe he's too aggressive, or, uh, well
Maybe the shit you doin' is just not impressive to a nigga
So let me make this clear
It won't be long 'til y'alls get more of what y'all gettin' right here
No, I ain't talkin' 'bout nobody comin' to Atlantic City
Talkin' 'bout, Oh, it's just a casino show
Or, It's just New Years, so we can't do nothin' really creative
No, I'm talkin' about a motherfucker workin' every day
From four o'clock in this buildin'
Readjustin' all these fuckin' cameras
To make this show better and better
Better every night for y'all
And all they can say, He got a mask on. He crazy
But they just tryin' to fuckin' deter you
From what you are seein' in front of you
This is Jesus Walks, this is Can't Tell Me Nothing
I'm not crazy, I'm just not satisfied
So maybe let this time open up your mind
And let you know that you can do anythin' in life
Yeah, baby, you can shine
This right here lets you know you can do anythin' in life
With enough time and focus and focus and time and time
And don't let nobody tell you
Cause ain't nobody fuckin' with my clique
When I look around, they don't do it like my clique
When I look around, they don't do it like my clique
When I look around, they don't do it like my clique, so here
Since they'll probably put this online
Let me make this shit real clear
Michael Jackson died from a lack of information
From motherfuckers bein' around him lyin' to him
Actin' like shit okay, but I'm a find the information
Don't believe nothin' that they say
Don't matter who you look up to
Don't take more than ninety percent of what the fuck they say
Cause they are not you
And that extra ten percent is what makes you you
So you do what the fuck you want to do
And if somebody tell you you can't do it
Be like, Man, who the fuck are you?
You only got one life that you know about, you only got
And time is somethin' you can never get back
Most important thing
Don't forget that time is somethin' that you never can get back
So don't forgot that cause the money could go
And you could spend it over and over
And over and over, over, over, oh
And the cars could crash
And now did that tell me, What do you have?
And the house can burn down
And whose your real friends when you turn around?
Yeah, that's your clique, clique, clique, clique, clique
Ain't nobody fresher than my motherfuckin' clique
Clique, clique, clique, clique
As I look around, they don't do like my clique
Clique, clique, clique, clique
And all these bad ladiesYeah, follow me, uh Picture Kendrick, one of the greatest emcees
Roamin' the coast like cellphones on airplane mode
I been at bat for so many years
Now I'm out swingin' like open marriages
Carry this terrorist flow, say that I'm arrogant
Stop playin', thinkin' back to rhymin' over computer mics
Knew I was tight the moment the speakers had broke
I dipped and dabbled in chronic, but never knew I was dope
You see, my uncles is killers, but never knew I could smoke
A rapper like a .357, do worse enemies
Was God-given, but now I'm God, hate to intervene
I sic a lyric on you like K-9's from the police
Let it rip through your briefs, till it bite through your culo
I'm Cujo,  sumo rapper
Heavy in the game, follow my name, K-Dizzle
A twenty-two-year-old dream, got now
Like a person place or thing hands down like 6:30
You heard me? I'm a motherfuckin' problem, puto
Give me respect, I hold it down for DJBooth.net
And they tell 'em K-Dot got next
And they tell 'em K-Dot got necked
From your baby momma
On my momma, brain like a genius
I'm travelin' to Venus
Where aliens got pistols 'round they V-necks
Snub-nose, Kleenex
I suppose I done drove artists to a place
Where the daily deceased sleep at
Competition comin' up short like a dwarf
But, of course, I'm a short fuse ready to blow
Go 'head and put your gun down, we can go toe-to-toe
Mano e mano, you ain't ready, I'm deadly as plec disease
God-given, you trippin', I've walked the Seven Seas
Moses, cold as they heart, cloned as art
Foamin' at the mouth, wildebeest slaughter opponents
'Bout business when I kicks this, ridiculous symphony
Tick-tock, boom when you infants give me some room
Central and Rosecrans, Compton don't raise killers
They raise Conans with survival tactics
You love drama? Well, welcome to the land of theatrics
Even a preacher be packin' like role managers damage your goods
Cameras roll through the hood, tryin' to get that footage
Even newscasters come to your block when you wouldn't
This the city at it's best, have a seat, hold your breath
A breath of fresh air, DJBooth.net and Dot
Kendrick Lamar, K-Dot, that is, ha-ha-ha, ha, yeahWater, water, water, water
Water, water, water, water I wish I was 40, I wish I was water
I wish I was 40, I wish I was water
I wish I was 40, I wish I was water
I wish I was 40, I wish I was water 40 different ways, 40 days, 40 nights
40 on the side, 40 thieves in the night
Been in the game for 20 years and I'm 40 years though?
6 A cougar, 40 years cold 40 ounce of brew, 40 this, 40 that
40 at the crap table shooting 40 stacks
40 thousands fans, 40 niggas on stage
I heard 40's 40 but 40 don't act his age 40 stay relevant, 40 ain't never played
40 ain't a punk, 40 will pull the gage
40 years change with the hawk sitting on her
40 ain't left the hood, 40 around the corner 40 like to drink, 40 be getting drunk
My brodies, a hip-o-holic, he smoke 40 blunts
40 kicks a blow, 40 pounds of grapes
Give me 40 feet and a ounce of space Water, water, water, water
Water, water, water, water I wish I was 40, I wish I was water
I wish I was 40, I wish I was water
I wish I was 40, I wish I was water
I wish I was 40, I wish I was water This that new water, this shit go
Water my grass and my green gone grow
It takes water to live, it's water under the bridge
Water with the baking soda whipping up kids It's a drought without water, the soil can't crack
Water in the duals makes loud glass packs
My family know me by Earl but water my handle
All the gooing in the club, drinking water like a camel Put some paint where it ain't, water based paint
If you don't drink no water, my ninja, you might faint
Water be everywhere but water from the V
Water be limping like he got water in his knee Water pour, water simmer, water heat
Keep my head above water, still water run deep
Water in my bong, water do the fruit
Water trust no one, ain't no leaks in my pool Water, water, water, water
Water, water, water, water I wish I was 40, I wish I was water
I wish I was 40, I wish I was water
I wish I was 40, I wish I was water
I wish I was 40, I wish I was water I don't be seeing anything, I be making sense
Y'all be looking for a walk, I be swing for the fence
Under pressure, never tense, rhyming is a synch
Change the rap game when they let me up off the bench Back with that 91 super Atlantic flow
I've done seen your favorite rappers come and go
I done seen a lot of blow, a lot of snow
I done seen my homie grandma get beat by the po-po In the hill side of Vallejo, County of Selano
Get off a magazine and meet me over there by McDonald's
That's why I used to get my yola stacks off
Back then I was small time, all I had was rocks Manage with it, a fixture on the streets
He a vegan, he don't like beef
They got their E's mixed up
I just look like this but I'd fuck a nigga up Water, water, water, water
Water, water, water, water I wish I was 40, I wish I was water
I wish I was 40, I wish I was water
I wish I was 40, I wish I was water

Diamonds are forever 
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever 
Everybody, everybody, the Roc is still alive every time I rhyme
Now say this, forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?
Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Close your eyes and imagine, feel the magic
Vegas on acid, seen through Yves St. Laurent glasses
I've realized that I've arrived
'Cause it take more than a magazine to kill my Vibe
Does he write his own rhymes? Well, sort of, I think 'em
That mean I forgot better shit than you ever thought of
Damn, is he really that caught up?
I ask, if you talkin' 'bout classics, do my name get brought up?
I remember I couldn't afford a Ford Escort
Or even a four-track recorder
So it's only right that I let the top drop on a drop-top Porsche
Spoil yourself, that's important
If your stripper name Porsche and you get tips from many men
Then your fat friend, her nickname is Minivan
Excuse me, that's just the Henny, man
I smoke, I drink, I'm supposed to stop, I can't, because— Diamonds are forever 
Uh, throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, the Roc is still alive every time I rhyme
Now say this, forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?
Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Uh, I was sick about awards, couldn't nobody cure me
Only playa that got robbed but kept all his jewelry
Alicia Keys tried to talk some sense in him
Thirty minutes later, seein' there's no convincin' him
What more could you ask for? The international asshole
Who complain about what he is owed?
Throw a tantrum like he is three years old
You gotta love it though, I still speak from my soul
Wouldn't change by the change or the game or the fame
Came in the game, he made his own lane
All I need is y'all to pronounce my name
It's Kanye, but some of my plaques, they still say Kayne
Got family in the D, Kin-folk from Motown
Back in the Chi, them Folks ain't from Moe Town
Life movin' too fast, you need to slow down
Girl ain't give me no ass, you need to go down
Father been said I need Jesus
So he took me to church and let the water wash over my caesar
The preacher said we need leaders
Right then, my body got still like a paraplegic
You know who you call; you got a message, then leave it
The Roc stand tall and you would never believe it
Take your diamonds, throw 'em up like you bulimic
Yeah, the beat cold, but the flow is anemic
After debris settles and the dust get swept off
Big K pick up where young Hov left off
Right when magazines wrote Kanye West off
I dropped my new shit, it sound like the best of
A&R's lookin' like, Pssh, we messed up
Grammy night, damn right, we got dressed up
Bottle after bottle 'til we got messed up
Studio, with Really Doe, yeah, he next up
People askin' me is I'm gon' give my chain back
That'll be the same day I give the game back
You know the next question, dog: Yo, where Dame at?
This track the Indian dance to bring our reign back
What's up with you and Jay, man? Are y'all okay, man?
They pray for the death of our dynasty like Amen
R-r-r-r-right here stands a man
With the power to make a diamond with his bare hands Diamonds are forever 
Uh, throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever 
Uh, the Roc is still alive every time I rhyme
Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?
Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?
Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?
In time you'll learn this is about you

Maybe we could still make it to the church steps
But first, you gon' remember how to furrget

Niggas can't stop me with rumors, Im too strong
All day, socks exploding sweat pants pockets is bulging
Holding it down on the corner with my block frozen
My spot is rolling, drop the price of the coke and
Drove the competition out and let the doe flow in
The cops is closing in, I can do the time
But whats really on my mind, there ain't no ho's in the pen
I play the low and try to make it hard to find me
Feds still tryna build a case since 93 Yo, moves is made, Niggas is paid, that's just how it is
When my time is up, Ima be out but ima try to live
I'm eating day by day ain't nothing sweet about it
Act like you don't know what I'm saying and they'll read about it
Built for war like an armadillo
Smother your ass with 2 through the pillow
Cause my shit is brillo
Manic depressive and my head hurts
Yo, give me your doe and your ho
And here take these four hot things, I got things
That make niggas spin, put niggas in the wind
Where you never see niggas again
I bless a nigga with stitches, the thin type
And a straight razor will put pin stripes, across your wind pipes Start off my day and I'm off and running and I miss my gun
I'm often blessed but not these days cause its no longer fun
I am way worse then a banger with 8 bullets left in the chamber
Can't imagine the danger, when you done got these bow ties angered
When strangers pissed me off, I got high to control it
You think I don't get tempted, that would be a lie if I told it, can't hold it
Outside opposition , got stress on my mind
But I got inside opposition, coming from my own kind and they're blind
We walk in peace but don't provoke us, we ain't gon' run
We fight with those who fight with us but nigga I ain't the one
You niggas oughta be glad OG got hold of us
Cause if it wasn't for that man, there be no controlling us
His body laid in red rum, twisted in broken poses
Blood puddle soaked in his clothes and it look like roses
Smelling Folgers and Moses couldn't save him
We leaving the way we came, As-salamu alaykum{*piano roll*} Well I mean Man. Ranking Scroo 'long side E-40, ya hear?
All crew, pick up yourself Thou respect who say, everything's kool  Fa Sho, Fa Sho Oooohh ooooh ooooh oooohhh  It's either gonna be him or me and I ain't finsta be either or

Autoloaders, Hunting rifles ya fucking with
Somebody gon mind somebody shit ya fucking with
We give a fuck about who ya with and whatever horse ya rolled in on
Ya ain't finna take me outta my zone
Cause I'mma stay getting my money on and be about me and mine
Watch out for salty ass niggas during daylight savings time
Cause that's around the time of the year when the splitter splatter
Folks be losing the lives, they kidneys, and gall bladder
We in the stink of it man, me and my runners and gunners
We come through dumping with those autoloader turkey hunters
Never lose sleep, never worry, never weep
You could spend that time praying that what the preacher be speaking
Them suckas like to cheat, watch the beef say its kool
Them double back pull out them hammers and tools
And bettybye your them harrington riches and varmen rifles screws
For bragging rights, just to say he made the news Oooohh ooooh ooooh oooohhh

So lift up ya foot and put it iny ya dancing shoes
Cause if ya fuck with us yo ya bound to lose Breakin News
If you mess with the bull your gonna get the horns
When the clouds is dark that means it's finna storm
If ya car is parked and the music is loud
That means ya setting off alarms in the crowd
When ya spider senses tell you that something is up
Then I suggest you go with ya gut
Don't ignore your first mind
Always pay attention to your warning signs
Always be awoke, always be aware, always look over ya shoulder
Always be alert of the rollers
When ya perking and ya sliding sipping Saint Ides or King Cobra
In ya scraper, feeling ya paper rubbing Donny Taylor or Clarence Carter
Alot Smarter than the average joe
Straight out the ghetto they call me E, 4, 0
Still hungry, still rapping like I'm still 'spose
Still money, still money on my mind folks
I never play out I'm just like Pea-Cokes
I survive in a drought, I sit on all my dope
And wait for the value to sky rocket
Make them client pay top dollars so when they come cop it Breakin News
This just in
Have money, have heart, have when
Cause ya never know when
Ya gotta fight to the death, you can't be running out of breath
Get in shape before its late
Im at 320 now but I used to weigh 358
My doctor made me lose weight, my doctor said Charlie Hustle
We gon turn all this fat that you got into mustle
But fools gon think that I'm smoking, no they ain't loc
You got High blood pressure, the leading cause of death among black folk
Er' since yo ass was just a lil kid
The slave masters would give him all the left over and crap from the pig
Enough of that, I said what I said
Now let's get back to bussing heads
Know when to act a fool and who to act a fool with
Know who to be cool with and who not to be cool with
Cause the same dude you grew up and went to school with
A be the same dude that cross you and try to get you hit
Cause misery love company and company loves misery
And money causes jealosy and envy Oooooh Oooooh Oooooh Oooohh

She had hair so long that it looked like weave
Then she cut it all off, now she look like Eve
And she be dealin' with some issues that you can't believe
Single black female addicted to retail, and well Oh, when it all, it all falls down
And when it falls down, who you gon' call now?
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
C'mon, c'mon, and when it falls down
Oh, when it all Man, I promise, I'm so self-conscious
That's why you always see me with at least one of my watches
Rollie's and Pasha's done drove me crazy
I can't even pronounce nothin', pass that Ver-say-see!
Then I spent four hundred bucks on this
Just to be like, Nigga, you ain't up on this.
And I can't even go to the grocery store
Without some Ones that's clean and a shirt with a team
It seem we livin' the American Dream
But the people highest up got the lowest self-esteem
The prettiest people do the ugliest things
For the road to riches and diamond rings
We shine because they hate us, floss 'cause they degrade us
We tryna buy back our 40 acres
And for that paper, look how low we'll stoop
Even if you in a Benz, you still a nigga in a coupe Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Come on, come on
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
And when it falls down, who you gon' call now?
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Come on, come on
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
And when it all falls down I say, Fuck the police, that's how I treat 'em
We buy our way out of jail, but we can't buy freedom
We'll buy a lot of clothes, but we don't really need 'em
Things we buy to cover up what's inside
'Cause they made us hate ourself and love they wealth
That's why shorty's hollerin', Where the ballers at?
Drug dealer buy Jordan, crackhead buy crack
And the white man get paid off of all of that
But I ain't even gon' act holier than thou
'Cause fuck it, I went to Jacob with 25 thou
Before I had a house and I'd do it again
‘Cause I wanna be on 106 & Park, pushin' a Benz
I want to act ballerific like it's all terrific
I got a couple past-due bills, I won't get specific
I got a problem with spendin' before I get it
We all self-conscious, I'm just the first to admit it Oh, when it all, it all falls down
C'mon, c'mon
And when it falls down, who you gon' call now?
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
C'mon c'mon, and when it falls down
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Southside, Southside
We gon' set this party off right
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
Westside, Westside
We gon' set this party off right
Oh when it all, it all falls down
Chi-Town, Chi-Town
We gon' show 'em how we get down
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
Now, Syleena, you just like a safe belt, you saved my life
C'mon
Oh when it all, it all falls down
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down 
The hardest thing for me to do
Is to get you, to know me, within sixteen bars
That's the hardest thing Who is K. Dot? A young nigga from Compton
On the curb writing raps next to a gunshot
On the corners where the gangsters and the killers dwell
The fraudulent tender scars that get unveiled
Everyone I knew was either Crip or Piru
Cousins in elementary, relatives in high school
With that being said, each one of their rivals
Was aiming something at my head, I needed survival
Got jumped, got jacked, shot at, shot back
And I don't even push a line, I'm just tryna push these rhymes
In the midst of staying neutral and discrete
My momma said you're judged by the company you keep
But what you can consider, that if it goes down
They'll kill you if you kill me, it gets deep nigga
So if you ask what I'm doing
I'm tryna duck the influence of my city that's brewing, real talk, and This is why they fuck with me 
This is why they fuck with me 
I'm no gangster, no killer, I'm just your average Joe 
But one thing you should consider, I'm the realest you know I was walking from Centennial
When an unidentified vehicle rolled up, and I was like hol' up
Where you from? I don't bang
Where you stay? Westside, that's a Piru gang to be exact
Well aware they had blue across they hat
Dropped backpack and ran inside of the cul-de-sac
Shots rang out, hoping to God I wasn't wet
Crossed across Rosecrans and ran inside of the yet
Chirped the homies on the I-95, they said they already knew
What happened, and meet 'em outside the garage
Never seen that many guns in my life
I was paranoid like a fiend in the night, but needed revenge
Grabbed the nine-ball, opened up the door, then got in
Somebody said fall back, we gon' make these niggas suffer
You my brother like a frat, and that's just to remind you
Thought about that so long I had failed my finals, fuck, but This is why they fuck with me 
This is why they fuck with me 
I'm no gangster, no killer, I'm just your average Joe 
But one thing you should consider, I'm the realest you know I don't do black music, I don't do white music
I do everyday life music
Give 'em cuts like a nigga pierced a knife through it
You say you through, but I've been through it, now that's cold
And this is for my county building children
In Hub City on hubcaps, no power-steering
I use perseverance in this mad city
Where the niggas drink Remy and hold semis for cutthroats
Bernie Mac died, it's no joke
Don't ask why if you don't know about these killers and thieves
Seven grams of weed, you smoke that, but I'm high off life
I could fall out the sky like twice
And land in the land of the AKs
And the minivans where the fan never on
Cause it's hotter than a lunatic's underarms in a straitjacket
In other words, we get it cracking, but I keep it cool, you know? This is why they fuck with me 
This is why they fuck with me 
I'm no gangster, no killer, I'm just your average Joe 
But one thing you should consider, I'm the realest you know So there you have it
But I'mma leave you with this
An O.G. once told me
A real gangster is either dead or in jail
Or behind the scenes getting real money
I'm gone
K-Dizzle I rap with a Pyrex in the projects
I'm crack in a pot, I'm a prospect
I'm a pirate on a dock full of dope
I can dissect any rapper
You could vote for the Lochness
You can not test no King in a Tesla
Bitch, I ride like a freight train parked outside
And my young niggas came with the extras, ah It's Alive...
I hear the girls scream soon as we arrivin'
You can ask Ibn, we be straight mackin'
Y'all work at IBM, hotels they be in
Ooh la la, tres bien magnifique
Any street Father is the black Bruce Wayne
Only shorty in preschool rockin' two chains If you talkin' 'bout marriage, you mean multi-million heiress

 Feeling like a mother fucking animal
Hannibal Lecter of 2012
Elected to execute every rapper that has excelled
If music is your calling
You're falling, pick up yourself
If a nigga said he could see me
Bet he told you in Braille, fucker
Put you in front of the street then buy you some bread
Nigga you lunch meat, should've worked at Subway instead
Goliath couldn't bare my triumph
I'm a leader, walk behind me as I walk through Zion
Swinging swords like I'm sparring with a Spartan
Watch they face drop when the beat drop
I drop a real jewel like a Martin, fool
Me and curtains ballin' like peewee kirkland callin' 'em kirk franklin
Stomp 'em, leave 'em hurting
No judgement for a plaintiff
They tried to find me guilty for spitting filthy as O.D.B
But I've been O.D. since '03
That's March 14th, my first recordings
I kicked it like sweet chin
Music on Chuck Norris Look, look, look
I'm J-A-Y, Rock to be exact
Niggas said gardens, Watts on the map
Hm, story of this eastside nigga
All my life in the ghetto on the peace side nigga
Where across the tracks, opposites attract
Niggas go hard for the color of they flag
Dope man money, welfare recipients
Unfit mothers never heard of obedience
Ho's so devious, niggas all talk
Right around the corner, deja vu
Same old shit, something like re-runs
Gotta stay sharp, if you slip then you bleed ?
Guns in the Levis, 501s
Niggas don't box, they buy more guns
Uh, that's how it is on these L.A. streets
Don't sleep, don't sleep
Look, catch me sitting in my truck
Remy in this cup
No tags on this bitch, but I don't give a fuck
I ride until the wheels fall off
That's some real shit
Never let them get in your mind, never reveal shit
Let a nigga know your feelings, business and all
He's the type of nigga riffing and wishing on you to fall
Fake niggas try and impersonate your character
That's why I got my mother's fucking eyes on them scavengers
Watch 'em!
My daddy told me that every day
Pray for late Charles, why he have to pass away?
Thinking about my pops, then the stress starts to kick in
Roll me up a fat ass blunt and start drinking
Damn!
Then reality starts to set in
I'm married to the streets and I ain't never had a wedding
I stop selling dope because niggas started telling
Sex, money, and weed: the life we start living
Guns in the closet for niggas who start tripping
Stay in the house when them choppers come out spitting
Stay on your job
Keep your eyes open on every corner
The blink of an eye, and you're a goner
No wronger, tell 'em about the pains of this hunger
Shock 'em like thunder
And the ? going bonkers
Just living my life up on some cool shit
So, nigga just miss me with all that bull shit  Greeting boys and girls 
My name is Petey P 
Kendrick's childhood imaginary friend 
I am your neighbor 
And I’d like to welcome you to good kid, m.A.A.d city 
So grab your cartoons and cereal 
Your pop guns and fireworks 
And sing along  When we grow up we gon go and get us a million
Spend it all in front of the county building
Blow it like Coltrane, blow it like Coltrane, yeah
Sing along kids, sing along
When we grow up we gon go and get us a million
Spend it all in front of the county building
Blow it like Coltrane, blow it like Coltrane, yeah Kendrick, you remember that one time when we was...
I’ve been waiting on this day since Dr. Dre and Pac
Was on Rosecrans in that burger stand at '95
People staring at 'em in amazement
Reservations at the Days Inn
We was living out a hotel at the time
Breakfast, lunch and dinner, chicken from Kentucky Fried
Mama babysitting Section 8 vouchers the move
When nothing else to lose but a burger flipping job
Close my eyes inside the swap meet and imagine it's a mansion
Gold ballroom, AK-47 dancin'
Howling at the moon, what’s a pack of hungry babies?
Hope you feed us soon, bite your back, you die of rabies
Everyday we pray to eat at the table at Sizzlers
But never make the visit, if better days was on its way
Then they make the decision, to make the wrong turn
So for now we heat this skillet so this canned food can burn
Oh yeah, I remember that, it- it was the ravioli with the hot sauce in it, right? When we grow up we gon go and get us a million
Am I right?
Spend it all in front of the county building
Oh!
Blow it like Coltrane, blow it like Coltrane, yeah
Don't forget to sing along by the way, sing along
When we grow up we gon go and get us a million
Spend it all in front of the county building
Blow it like Coltrane, blow it like Coltrane, yeah And all the ghetto children in the world say, “that’s my car” 
All the ghetto boys say, “that’s my car” 
All the ghetto girls say, “that’s my car” 
When we grow up, when we grow up 
Ghetto children in the world say, “that’s my car” 
All the ghetto boys say, “that’s my car” 
All the ghetto girls say, “that’s my car” 
When we grow up, when we grow up  Nigga you remember the smoke and the burning buildings and shit?
Couple stolen T.V.'s and a seat belt for my safety 
Played the passenger I think it’s five years after eighty 
Seven, do the math, ‘92, don’t you be lazy 
Looking out the window, notice all the essentials
Of a block party that stop for a second, then it rekindle
Like a flame from a trick candle, everybody got dental
Insurance ‘cause we ‘bout to floss, you get that couch I sent you?
I heard that from a block away, probably had credentials
Of a scholar but, shit, not today, them Dayton Spokes was his to take
Refrigerators, barbecue pits, and Jordan kicks
They did invasions while helicopters recorded it
Hello Mi-Mister Miyagi, I want them Kenwood woofers
Say that you got me, if not, I’ll dig in your drawer for it
The swap meet was the bulls' eye like Tauruses
Murder was the melody you should know what the chorus is
Papa, you really telling me we can just get some more of it
If we run out? He said, Lil' nigga, today the poor is rich
Don’t tell your mom that you seen a Molotov bomb
If she ask just know you have to lie and son don’t forget
Bitches ain’t shit, hoes ain’t neither
Niggas gon' snitch, watch the company you keeping
And one day you’ll put money in the ghetto when you got it
Rather than having to hustle off these Rodney King riots
That- that’s right the mothafuckin’ Rodney King...
You was with your daddy on Bullis Road When we grow up we gon go and get us a million
That's crazy
Spend it all in front of the county building
Blow it like Coltrane, blow it like Coltrane
Don't forget, still sing along kids, still sing along
When we grow up we gon go and get us a million
Please sing
Spend it all in front of the county building
Blow it like Coltrane, blow it like Coltrane

What they buck? Are y'all fools ready for dis? It's a loco for sure I'll blast

 'Cause what you have can be gone in a blink

What really matters is not what you think

So be sure you show some appreciation
 Tough times, no goals
Dark hearts, lost souls
Snakes, sharks, black roles

I had my own little business on the side, a sort of sideline... a rather confidential sort of thing... but you might make a nice bit of money. Hundred dollar bills Benjamin Franklins filled, fold it just for the thrill
Go numb until I can't feel, or might pop this pill
Stock markets just crash, now I'm just a bill

Write like Mark Twain, Jay Gatsby, I park things
Yellow cars, yellow gold like Slick Rick, still tip

And people are shady My generation is changin
Aside from the fact
The dealers have customers they provide with the crack
Front of the buses taken
And we deny it from the back
You can die where you from, or die where you at Don't put it past them
I don't think that they understood
My friends they ain't even sit in the class when they should
He can come pick you up
If your dads in the hood
Not bad meaning bad, but bad meaning good good good Lady, somebody shot up the place right by
Where I work and I think they might
Be coming for me next
Lend me ya kleenex
I'm tellin you baby
I think I'm a bout to cry
Still gotta go out tonight
Cuz I gotta feed you
I hope that I see you again... again
Hope that I see you, see you Lately I don't know about the friends that I hang with
I'm nervous round my boys, it depends on their anguish
Depends on if they saving all the tops on pepsi
With dreams of seeing girls topless on jet skis
Depends on what they do to achieve that
Robbing r&b singers, 'specially if they know where the keys at
'specially if they know where they girl live
Get the info, leave with ya money man, thats how the world is Thats how niggas puttin they dirt down
Streets are seedy, I call em sesame
It's Ernie and Bert's town
'specially when these young'ns get turned down for work opportunities
Next week same place'll get burnt down
Coincidink? not likely not a chance
How can we be so aware of these problems and not advance?
At least start put a bid in, its hard just to fit in
A lot of people only play they part when they spittin
But I don't think that they understood
They using this darkness for penetration in the hood
I took the ivory way in and yes I'm glad that keenan could
Not bad meaning bad, but bad meaning good good good Not bad meaning bad, but bad meaning good
Not bad meaning bad, but bad meaning good good good
Alchemist, you know me, man
I'm the type of nigga that write rhymes
Right on the spot in the studio soon as I hear the track
You know what I'm sayin'?
Word, but I wanted to bring
A couple of books to the studio today, man
I found these shits up in the crib, man, in boxes, man
I don't even remember when I was writin' these shits
Or what's in these shits, man
Probably a bunch of bullshit, man… fuck it, check it How can I trust you when I can't trust me?
Picture myself a old man, a O.G.
Some niggas will conversate with liars all day
Time pass— 
Soul on ice, death threats given by clowns
I guess livin' is prison when you live around clowns
I'm hexed, cursed, worse I been blessed first
I thought I was abnormal
‘Cause I would overcome any tasked called to
So there it is, I'm a prince, I'm against lames
Who do minor shit, swear they on the top of they game
Your rhymin' is called Vagina Monologue, it kinda supports
Theories of scary niggas who should lie in the morgue
Rarely y'all come in contact with the real
Since Pun passed, he was the last shine of sun I could feel
Yo, said there's a few left since music's expressions of life
Damn, I wish I took more time to write in my book of rhymes Oh shit, Tina!
I been lookin' for this bitch number, damn
No, this rhyme is weak
This is weak, I remember this bullshit right here

Gandhi was a… what the fuck? Gandhi was a fool, nigga, fight to the death
The US Army is a school that teach you plights of conquest

The money's your religion, sky the limit, live life
Numbers is big business, makes the poor live trife
The glimmers of hope provoke those without dollars to dream
Through your existence become wealthy, knowledge is king
Pimps and card sharks, thiefs, murderers with hard luck
Addicts and fiends prostitutes passin' for teens is my society
Cops that shoot blacks is routine for notoriety
Grow up watchin' well-dressed niggas with charms
Beautiful ladies on their arms
Dangerous new cars was my fantasy for Nas
Rubbin' my lips with Campophenique
Still behind the ears wet, turned out to be
Pioneers vets amongst hustlers, crack sellers, and liars and squares

My people be projects or jail, never Harvard or Yale
Pardon me type in my two-way while I'm chargin' my cell
It's hard to be iced up with Gucci, God, poverty's real
I can't fight you, ‘cause you would sue me, niggas be groupies
I see imitators tryin' to make albums, spittin' my style
And they don't even realize that I notice they stealin' Nas' shit
I pump some Rick James with that Teena Marie
My nina lean on me like Scoob and Scrap
This can't be my book of rhymes This can't be my book of rhymes, writin' this bullshit!

Nah, neva that! Fuck that!
Aw, why you laughin', Alchemist?
Hah, you a funny nigga...
Naw, yeah 
I'm tellin' you, I'ma come up with some new shit now
Fuck that! I'ma write again now, fuck that!
I musta been high on some shit… what the fuck is this?! Look how we treat pregnancy, women in the hood
Our values so low, our values are no good
Things our mothers told us we should've heeded
‘Cause now we need it, we older, almost able t—
I'm jealous of you, how come you so beautiful?
Smellin' fresh, youthful, intelligent, while I'm stressin' and shit
Ayo, I envy you ‘cause all you do is smile
And things come your way
Such a innocent child is what some say
I get upset ‘cause I just want to be treated the way you are
Like a star, not a worry in this world thus far
But wait a minute, we both need your mother's attention
I must be crazy, jealous of my own baby infant 
And you say New York City
Uh-huh
Put your hands together
Young!
Uh-huh
Yeah, uh-huh
Yes!  I'm from the '80s
Home of the her-on
Era of the hustlers, uh
The world is my custies
New Rich Porter
The way I flip quarters
Front on all these other rap artists, but me
Momma was a mink wearer, papa ran numbers
So it's plain to see where my whole plan come from
American dream, I'm living the life still
Way I shine is like a zillion dollar light bill
Still I'm grinding, army jacket lining
40 below Timbs on, getting my M's on
My best friend's gone
I seen bad days, still find songs that I hear him on
Getting my Mary J. Blige Reminisce on
I hear his voice in my mind like, nigga live on
So I get on that fly shit I been on
Spin on corners in Enzo with rims on
But for info, puffing on Endo-Nesia
Give me amnesia
I ease up, that right, I'm high nigga
I want the sky
The world when I'm done
I'm give it to my sons
Let 'em live it up, split it up, switch it up, uh
Sixes kit it up, man I did it up, done
The rest of my belongings belong in the hall of fame
A list of hits next to all my names
I came 
I want the sky baby
I want the sky baby If the sky should fall
And it all goes tomorrow and they foreclose on the house
And auction off all my cars
Don't cry for me Argentina, I mobbed the Beamer
Took trips abroad, got mobbed in Sardinia
In Ibiza, I had pizza in the club
Ladies know I'm that guy, they wanna piece of my love
Now they wanna do your boy like Mike in his prime
Billie Jean, the goddamn boy ain't mine
And the Roc break up, had the people losing hope
Can't lie, they had Muhammad Hovi on the ropes
Now I'm back in the go mode, back in the go-go's
Throwing the diamond up, repping the logo
Rose gold, Rosé flow, I'm okay though
What don't kill me makes stronger than before so
Here we go and I'm not Domino
When it all falls down, I'm like Kanye's jaw
I might break but I don't fold, 'til I hold the sky in my hand
Yeah, that's my goal
And then I bid you Freddy Adu
Prodigal Child, y'all not ready for the fu-ture, ture
Then I disappear in the Bermuda Triangle
My name will be viewed such
Here's to the man that refused to give up
I want the sky nigga, chuuurch I want the sky baby

Rap guys get bank and think they messiahs, but they liars
Vote fo who now? You're red, white and blue?
I'm American too, but I ain't with the president's crew
What you peddlin' and who you peddlin' to?
You ain't got the ghetto with you
Try'na lead my sheep to the slaughterhouse
Talkin 'bout +Rap the Vote+, you ain't thought about
The black vote mean nathan, who you gonna elect
Satan or Satan? In the hood nothin is changin, uh
We ain't got no choices who to choose
Ten-years ago they were tryin to stop our voices
And end Hip-Hop, they some hypocrites
Condoleeza Rice - I don't really get this chick
Tell her if she ever really cared about poor schools
About poor children, then she gotta prove that she
Ain't just another coon Uncle Tom fool
Like these MC's, gotta give 'em the rules
Lie to the youth, Uncle Tom you confused
Might as well give the Hip-Hop community a noose
Need a truce with the gangs and some food for the hungry
On Kerry nuts, he look at you like a monkey
You MC's on that old slavery path
The Bushs'll look at yo' ass and laugh
See, it's all about community, let's help ourselves
Cops brutalize us get dealt with with shells
It's our turn, it's 'bout time we win
Need somebody as the hood as my councilman, uh Yeah I think about this everyday, that's the American Way, shit
Yeah I think about this everyday, that's the American Way, shit

Yeah I think about this everyday, that's the American Way, shit
Yeah I think about this everyday, that's the American Way Up in the steam room chillin', exfoliating the skin
It's rarely men conversatin' on ends, probably businessmen
I sense good taste, and they watch us, the spots an expensive place
Manhattan New York, I'm try'na keep steamin'
It's good for the lungs, had plans for the evening
This man leans in, his boys laughing
Now I'm the spokesperson for Black men, this always happens
Says, Since all Black women care about is who got dough
And all we do is call them either bitch or a Black hoe
I say first brotha you ain't gotta be that cold
Since you ignorant, I'ma show you how the facts go
The biggest example in scandal of history
Were Monica Lewinksy or Donald Trump's pimping spree
Most woman who love Jeevanji of Gucci
Are pretentious non-Black groupies or floozies
But who are we to blame, not the dames
It's a man-made game, in essence our woman the same
Beautiful creatures, Black girls birthed the earth
So they deserve to earn man's purse
Matter fact, I'm about to go shopping with my dime
Catch you cowards the next time, the next rhyme, uh Yeah I think about this everyday, that's the American Way, shit

Yeah I think about this everyday, that's the American Way, shit

Yeah I think about this everyday, that's the American Way, shit

Yeah I think about this everyday, that's the American Way, shit
 I don't care about the runaways
I don't care about who's gay
I don't care about dying of AIDS
But I care if I got paid
Who even cares about the president?
I think they're making a mistake
I don't care about the hurricane
As long as my family's safe
I don't care about the candidates
They burnt this country to bits

You know it's not overnight
Let's start the fight 
Can we make a change

Latest car on the market with the top peeled off it
Big wheels make it look a little bulky

The cops used to come around in my neighborhood
Alright, you kids, stop having so much fun, move along!
Oh they'd arrest me, you know, especially at night
They had a curfew, niggas had to be home at 11, negros, 12
And you'd be trying to get home, doing your crew runs
And they'd always catch you out in front of a store or something
'Cause you'd be taking shortcuts, right

We left E11even, at 11 AM 
Raw papers full of peace, cups full of mayhem 
We all wavy, I'm just sort of on a different wavelength 
See they more like superstars, I'm more like Super Saiyans 
Bein' the greatest ever is my destiny still 
Since a child I focused on my Kelly, Bey, and Michelle 
Sittin' back, getting head from a mademoiselle 
Tryin' to put every ghetto kid with a dream in my will 
Dedicated to you for the 6th time, killed it on the 5th one
Now they say I'm big time
While them niggas skipped lunch, I learned how to skip lines
I learned how to kick, punch, power through to get mines
Used to fuck with Sega, my uncle had a pager 
I knew this drug kingpin that tried to run for Mayor 
Posted on the back blocks, talkin' player-player
If she bad then I upgrade her, get her unlimited data 
They tryin' to build a wall, man my dogs gon' hate that shit
And build underground railroads, so the Maybachs fit
Yeah, we in the game, but we don't play that shit
Cover your soul before they take that shit
Young Right nigga, wrong nigga, dope nigga, ill nigga
Rich nigga, Polo nigga, house bigger, bills bigger
Sick nigga, Hill nigga, lit nigga, chill nigga
Racks nigga, real bigger, Shaq-bigger, lil nigga
Facts nigga, trill nigga, tax nigga, still nigga
Coke-on-coke, nigga, slopes, niggas, hills, nigga
Joke, nigga? No, nigga, clip bigger, quick trigger
Thick strippers, I ain't into stick figures, mixed signals
O.J. with the brick, nigga runnin' through the white
Nigga, O.J. on my wrist, nigga, that's Sunny Delight
Nigga, diamonds in my teeth, shinin' like some pearly whites
Nigga straight from New Orleans, like a plate of dirty rice
Nigga bought a lot of art, and I brought a lot to snort, hey
Beat around a bush, right after we beat the court case
Talking 'bout a war, that's a convo at the bar, wait
Drugs in the Broncos, start the motherfuckin' horse race
I take off from Earth and take your bitch up into MySpace
I tell her keep her mouth shut, if not, I got some Scotch tape
Got to keep the lock safe, referring to the Safelock
The shelves fall, the ground shake, it make it do the James Brown
I still wear the same crown, light-skin or light-brown
I still dick her right down, hit her with the pipe bomb
Some niggas like to fight crime, some niggas like to fight fair
Some niggas got the right time, you ask him, he say, Time'll tell
Some niggas think they're icons, some bitches think that I care
Some niggas got a iPhone, some niggas had a SkyTel
Some niggas really pythons, I'm watchin' out for myself
Tattoos, black skin, red eyes, blonde hair
Lyin' there, lookin' like Aww, yeah, lawn chair
Jumped right off the Con-Air and landed on a timeshare
I wear Versace eyeware, feelin' like top shelf
Cool as two Ls and Rock Bells, hot as Scottsdale
Bombshell Blackin' out, blackin' out
We on the drugs, blackin' out, blackin' out, blackin' out, blackin' out
All the guns, black it out, black it out, black-black-black it out
On the run, actin' out, actin' out, actin' out, actin' out, yo 
Yeah, blackin' out, blackin' out
We on the drugs, blackin' out, blackin' out, blackin' out, blackin' out
All the guns, black it out, black it out, black-black-black it out
On the run, actin' out, actin' out, actin' out, yo

Popped 'em all, then popped in the jaw of Tracy Veronica
Holla back they promised us
No pajamas insomnia
Will attack, I attack like piranha does
Hit your block like a comet 
And you all know what time it is
2012, mark your calendars calisthenics and silencers exercisin' that trigger strap
Rock with us Metallica, competition no talented
I'm in a jungle what's wild enough
Just might stumble upon a pack of lions
No lyin' my soldiers dyin' this is Iraq
Alliances lining with stars and bars of a prison rep
My science applyin' pressure her stretcher is needed pay the proceeds
Or your livin' debt y'all soft as a giga-pet
You niggas can't see me unless you watchin' the TV or ultra huggin' my silhouette
My flow got the ceiling wet

Who sinkin' my fuckin' chest
She fuckin' the fuckin' best
Mean my dick is the dick of death
Means I'm killin that pussy
Like Spike whenever that Jerry slept Yeah Dre
Me and Andre the Giant, 6'7 and climbin'
Whether you storm to your climate
Whether your beat makin' or rhyming
Bumpin some Phyllis Hyman
Hand full of diamonds like Jay fans
On a island with Ray Bans
Glasses palmin' asses that probably came wit a great tan 
I be the motherfuckin' mecca of these hub city spectrum
Where they at I will dissect them like a fucking frog rectum
Why you wreckin' with irreputable my worst flow incredible
They probably call the federal after I slaughter several
Etcetera etcetera Bentley passin up Celicas
They tellin' us about shit, HiiiPoWeR in your mouth, bitch
And Top Dawg can vouch bitch
Nigga what you 'bout, about face with army outfits
The generals here
That mean the hustlers and the criminals here
Penitence reachin' pinnacles of life and despair and me I solemnly swear to handle mine like a Taliban and die for it
Only difference is I ain't never askin' Allah for it
Only difference is I be spazzin' and still a proud poet
Put me in a category
I don't know what's a sadder story
Guts and glory
Your pain bore me you ain't really lived it
I take you to a block where they Crippin
Or Piru that 5'2 gun bigger than the torso of Pippen
Bitch I been doin' before you niggas ruined it
Show me somethin' different
You either kissin' dick or givin' me distance
You live in a district of dimebags and dummies I know your statistics
Who your boss, he more like my assistant

Break fast when we aimin' them biscuits
Pay cash when your chain come up missin'
Q...Q Double up, shit, what the fuck?

But I'm a giant, like Fe-Fi-Fo-Fum
Just bought a new crib inside Sodom
Got some money put away in case the hurricane come
I'm a fucking shame, huh? Yeah I know, yeah I know
I go out the country to get all my clothes and my hoes
I go out my way just to get my dro and my dough
'Cause I love it more than I love my hoes, yes I does
I got gasoline coming out my pores, I'm a torch
I got glasses like that white boy Scott Storch, and a Porsche
I got license for the scorch, snipers at your porch
Rifles by the forts and we shoot up courts
The judge just a bitch, the jury suck dick
I'm an Eastside Blood and I don't smoke that Crip
I smoke that Kush, first name Bubba
First name Young, last name Stunna
Carter in the office, take notes when I'm talking
Smooth as a cruise boat floats when I'm walking
I boast cause I'm balling, I'm supposed to be balling
When I'm on the phone with bitches, man, the money keep calling
You ain't satisfied 'til your son'll be calling
Telling you where to leave the money in the morning
OK, you want a zombie movie instead
That's when you walk in your house and everybody dead
Yeah, I could take a shit where I stand, where I stand
And watch you pussies piss in your pants
You ain't a man, you're a ho, I could kill him with the flow
And then play the guitar at the fucking funeral
Big guns so they drinking big shots
And my gang go Saddam Hussein and missile launch
The Korean call me Wayne Chang, now listen ma
I don't know karate, but after the brain, I'll kick you out
You niggas suck like Tony Romo, no homo
And I'm all about my money, I get paid for promo
Yeah, I'm the man in this bitch
They say money talks, well I'm the ventriloquist
And if I ever jump, I'll probably land in your bitch
Boy that ho colder than my hand and my wrist
Boy I'm more cooler than a fan and a mint
And when I'm done this track will need a couple bandages
I be with savages and I'm above average
I'm a crazy ass star like a fucking asterisk
You niggas can't see me, I'm on my Casper shit
Runnin' so much game, I'll fuck around and lap a bitch
The club like a grocery, I just bag a bitch
And you know I'm gonna score like Deion after picks
I'm rollin' on a pill, she get that morning after dick
And when my roll came down, guess what I did after it?
I pop-popped, and took some Patron shots
I pop-popped, and took some Grey Goose shots

Rest in peace Chris Lighty
Ahhh! Ahhh!
I remembered you was conflicted
Misusing your influence
Sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screaming in the hotel room
Lucifer was all around
So I kept running
Until I found my safe haven
I was trying to convince myself the stripes I got
Making myself realize what my foundation was


But while my loved ones were fighting the continuous war back in the city, I was entering a new one
A war that was based on apartheid and discrimination Ay on my momma nigga 
I'mma be the greatest to ever do this shit
On my momma doe like
On the dead homies
Aye Sounwave turn this shit up nigga
Turn this shit up! Sounwave, turn this shit up nigga
Tell me, who the bitch nigga hatin' on me?
Jumping on my dick, but this dick ain't free
To Pimp a Butterfly another classic CD
Ghetto lullaby for every one-day MC

Nigga, now R.I.P
My diligence is only meant to write your eulogy Alls my life I has to fight, nigga
Alls my life I...
Hard times like, God!
Bad trips like, Yea!
Nazareth, I'm fucked up

Nigga, we gon' be alright
Huh? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright Uh, and when I wake up
I recognize you're lookin' at me for the pay cut
But homicide be lookin' at you from the face down
What Mac-11 even boom with the bass down
Schemin', and let me tell you 'bout my life
Painkillers only put me in the twilight
Where pretty pussy and Benjamin is the highlight
Now tell my momma I love her but this what I like, Lord knows
20 of 'em in my Chevy, tell 'em all to come and get me
Reapin' everything I sow, so my karma come
And heaven no preliminary hearing, so my record
I'm a motherfuckin' gangster in silence for the record
Tell the world I know it's too late
Boys and girls, I think I gone cray
Drown inside my vices all day
Won't you please believe when I say Wouldn't you know
We been hurt, been down before
Nigga, when our pride was low
Lookin' at the world like, Where do we go?
Nigga, and we hate po-po
Wanna kill us dead in the street fo sho
Nigga, I'm at the preacher's door
My knees gettin' weak, and my gun might blow
But we gon' be alright Nigga, we gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Huh? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright What you want, you a house, you a car?
40 acres and a mule, a piano, a guitar?
Anything, see my name is Lucy, I'm your dog
Motherfucker, you can live at the mall
I can see the evil, I can tell it, I know it's illegal
I don't think about it, I deposit every little zero
Thinkin' of my partner, put the candy, paint it on the Regal
Diggin' in my pocket, ain't a profit big enough to feed you
Everyday my logic, get another dollar just to keep you
In the presence of your chico... ah!
I don't talk about it, be about it, everyday I sequel
If I got it then you know you got it, heaven, I can reach you
Pat Dawg, Pat Dawg, Pat Dawg, my dog, that's all
Bick back and Chad, I trap the bag for y'all
I rap, I black on track so rest assured
My rights, my wrongs; I write 'til I'm right with God Wouldn't you know
We been hurt, been down before
Nigga, when our pride was low
Lookin' at the world like, Where do we go?
Nigga, and we hate po-po
Wanna kill us dead in the street fo sho
Nigga, I'm at the preacher's door
My knees gettin' weak, and my gun might blow
But we gon' be alright Nigga, we gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Huh? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright I keep my head up high
I cross my heart and hope to die
Lovin' me is complicated
Too afraid, a lot of changes
I'm alright, and you're a favorite
Dark nights in my prayers I remembered you was conflicted
Misusing your influence, sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screaming in the hotel room
I didn't wanna self-destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went running for answersYo it's the Lake Shore Drive
Keep it live, tight, raw
You better hurry up, they can't keep it in the store
To be the format, your whole style on one beat
Insert the disk, watch a nigga press delete
Tryna flex your technique
You gettin' blasted with a TEC, that shit is mad ironic
Like Alanis Morisette, you try but can't jet
Bunch of airline lyrics, rhymes for low fare
Flyin' out of O'Hare
While these no-name ass niggas wanna go there, nobodies
Livin' three blocks from nowhere, down the street from nothin'
Let me show these niggas somethin', visual aid, the page
And the nigga who fronted, word to God, they don't want it
But they wanna play the role, actin' hardcore
Watch the whole career, flow, my style is too cold
Always, forever like Luther, but it ain't original
Because I stole it from the future, now I'm wanted in three centuries
The verbal killin', ask me where I got the style
Told 'em from my grandchildren, put it on files
Document it in the books
You niggas can't see me so cease the hard looks
I'll rather it get took
Live and die for rhymes, dedicated to hip-hop
Shit don't stop
Niggas they wanna know what and who's next
And you roll up in a Lex
That's the train stop, my brain drop mad lyrics
I rhyme with the spirit off the top, I drop nonstop
Verbally killin', my style is ready to willin'
Y'all niggas stay back chillin'
Like EPMD y'all niggas ain't seein' me, what
We're enormous, nah, do or die
I got the rhymes on the brain
They tried to bomb me on the plane so I rode the train
Before I got here, spawned here
I'm 'bout to save this shit, yo it's my year, what!?
Bring it on, pass it to my man Tariq
Rock the mic all week
This is a journey
Into the world's most largest and notorious projects
Queensbridge
Listen while Nas saves his hood from the most cowardest rappers He held a mass appeal and a likkle boy smile
Depressed has a complex his mouth was foul
You need to stay around I feel like tellin' some stories
First there's this arrogant fuck, his name's Cory
Hung around my man's Lakey and Big Trevor
Trevor's still locked up, Lake's gettin' his cheddar
Corey changed his name to ahh, whatever
Cornchip, Buckwheat look-a-like, it's Mega
Right, Mega was his name, sorry about that
 to put a coward's name in my rap
Always actin' tough, a jokester be frontin'
He got snuffed, he got shot in the thigh, he did nothin'
But that's Nas always lookin' out for bredren
Cause when bredren don't return love it don't stress him
Cause gangstas do gangsta shit, real recognize real
Still laughin' to the bank and shit
Back to Cor', got him a deal but his rhymes was wack
Def Jam mad that he signed the contract
Now he got jealous and mad at my shine
Making silly tapes, I'm always on his mind
Nonsense, not to be obnoxious kid
Mega for the record you could suck my dick
Bitch, you from around the way it's sad what this do to me
But Queensbridge, we gotta have unity They say 
Nah this is the time we destroy and rebuild it
They say 
Nah we the strongest hood but weak niggas kill it
So they say 
Nah this is the time we destroy and rebuild it
They say 
Nah we the strongest hood but it's these cowards that kill it
So they say Since we on the subject of traitors and flunkies
Mega ain't the only faggot in my hood, dummies
There's plenty that wanna be me but cannot
Its like King Arthur and Knight Sir Lancelot
Lefty and Donnie Brasco, Gotti and Paul
Before I woulda told you Prodigy's my dog
Through the ups and downs, robberies and all
Though I always knew he wanted my downfall
He would say his little slick shit and act real funny
For what, nigga? You're butt and it got back to me
Askin' a Braveheart to get back your jewelry
You ain't from my hood, don't even rep Q.B
Nature moved to Marcy
 nothing else to say
Man Nature moved to Marcy 
(Backward ass niggas, man fuck them niggas
Go head with the program man proceed)
Old lady pocketbook snatcher, car thief
Of course we ain't friends, you never stood on no blocks
Streets or corners with zombies, ghouls and gangstas
Cops, drug dealers with pools of blood anger
Just fills me when niggas let out of town to set shot
And get filthy rich, its just not
No more morals, no loyalty, no more community
Queensbridge, we gotta have unity They say 
Nah this is the time we destroy and rebuild it
They say 
Nah we the strongest hood but weak niggas kill it
So they say 
Nah this is the time we destroy and rebuild it
They say 
Nah we the strongest hood but it's these cowards that kill it
So they say I put the name on the map after Marley and Shan
Q.B. before the ROC had one jam
Before the Death Row and Bad Boy beef
Had streets locked with raw talent, I laugh at the weak
So this about cleanin' up house, my own backyard
Famous home of rap stars well known be getting robbed
P, how many times ain't you shamed that
Jungle was bustin' his gun to get your weak chain back
They don't respect you a cheque's due for me for your fame
Mega I hope you blow so I'm sayin' your name 
Hoes play your position 'cause you'll never be King
Even Jigga want the crown: How that sound? Poor thing!
I'm representin' Queensbridge U.S.A
Where two SK's go off every day ruthless-lay
All you little roaches and rats
Besides my man Ricky, Nas the true ruler is back
So haters say They say 
Nah this is the time we destroy and rebuild it
They say 
Nah we the strongest hood but weak niggas kill it
So they say 
Nah this is the time we destroy and rebuild it
They say 
Nah we the strongest hood but it's these cowards that kill it
So they say The Bridge is over, my dick!
The Bridge'll never be over, long as I'm alive and breathin'!
Braveheart to the graveyard! I'm the William Wallace of this shit
Ayo P, Prodigy I got love for you man, I love you man
You know what I'm sayin'?
Just get them unloyal niggas from out your circle!
You can't save everybody!
Niggas invited you to the hood - rep it right my nigga!
Be untouchable, my nigga
So it be Mobb for life for real, and that's real!
Ayo Nature, I can't hold your hand through this shit man!
I'm not your father, man!
Be your own man, stand on your own two!
I believe in you, believe in yourself, nigga
Or dont even rep this, man!
Ayo Mega you wanna be a gangsta?
There's real gangsta shit going on in the streets man!
Yo niggas is in the grind! Where you be at man?
Niggas be buckin'!
Why you never buckin'? Where you be at, man?
All of a sudden you the motherfuckin' Nino Brown of the fuckin' hood?
It's disgusting, man! Stay out the magazines!
Keep my name out your motherfuckin' mouth!
There's no more room for jealousy, we destroyin' and rebuildin':
That means the cowards get out and real niggas stay!
Niggas been hating me since I been nine
Shining with suede motherfucking Bally's on and silks
I'ma always be the young don
Don't be like the niggas on the other side:
Hating me cause I'm beautiful!
Real niggas in Queensbridge:
You niggas come up and get this money and move on baby!
Q.BNone
Aww man
Ho! Yes!
Hahaha
Yeah... Can y'all hear me out there?
It's a lovely night tonight ain't it?
Yeah I know
I know what they thinkin' they ain't heard the beat they aleady scared
You know how I get down
But look I'm just gon keep it real I'd like to know if there is a chemical
Imbalance in your makeup
Yeah

Sometimes I wonder... wonder if you plan
Half of this shit before I wake up

Callin my ex-girl or e-mailin my mama 
You're the only one
That's causin me this drama
And then expect favors 
When you come in town
And I know if I see you guaranteed it's goin down Cause
Too stay with this girl 
You couldn't pay me!
I respect a woman
But this bitch is crazy 
This bitch is crazy 
This bitch is crazy
I respect a woman 
But this bitch is crazy She don't even know
That's the craziest part right?
She just oblivious to the whole shit like
And you know like I was sayin sometimes
I gotta get my R&B on you know
I wanna wear the wife beaters
With the slit at the top so
I can tear it easy and all that
I wanna sing in the rain girl
You know what I'm talkin bout
Yea
I need a R&B name too like uh... like uh... like
I don't know I'll think of it
Hey!
Hahaha
You crazy man for real
Ho!
Oh well nigga fuck that ho!
Goddamn
I said it without sayin it man
And when you spiral through the atmosphere
All they see is motion
They never see the tears, they never feel the pain
They always think it's nothing but it's something, such a shame
So caught up in the fantasy
Humanity has made a love story out of tragedy
But there is no romance in life that's on the ledge
And there's no one to talk you down and tuck you in the bed
Lord, it's so ironic that it's funny
Or something for the books or the bars
To bob your head and nod, I recall
So many never ever thought you'd make it
So sad they were mistaken, the joy they tried to take it
Mama said it, The best thing you can do and be is you
This world ain't got but one, so give credit where it is due
Ain't that the truth? And here you are, a black unicorn
Mythical, mystical, since the day that you were born
Mastered all the madness, let the magic have his way
Let the power paint the day, let the god have his say
Cause there's a place that you can go, no one else is allowed
Sitting up on your cloud, so high when you look down
Just glance upon the beauty and the wonder to be found
Then know that you can stop your search, cause love is all around Free at last, free at last
That's what I said when I got out my last deal
Some people can't relate
Sleep is the cousin of death, that is some Nas shit
And when it's cold outside, so your pipes won't bust
Turn on your faucet
Drip, fuck the water bill, we stay in apartments
And everything is a obstacle
When they watching you, the hospital needs a hospital
Now they mocking you, they say the flattery is sincere
I rhyme like a nigga younger than me by ten years
Yeah, and that's my car talking
Old school running with the dogs barking
Hop out that bitch like I'm sellin' coffins
Weed so strong, I be seldom coughing
And I'm covered in Balmain
Instagram pics of my lobster omelette
Selling that Parkay, life ain't no arcade
Now I got more nines than the fourth grade Freedom, it's all I really want
It's all I really want to be
It's all I really need
I want, I want and I believe
You thought you had the best of me
But now I'm what you need Hear ye, hear ye, you can't come near me
Competition best to fear me
Lyrically I could be Talib Kweli
But with gold teeth, it'd be hard for some to believe
I leave them pussies stinking, they need Summer's Eve
I practiced repetition, I need 100 G's
100 M's, hug and squeeze, Dad kept this in the dungarees
I'm not a rat but I love the cheese
I change hoes like I change gears
And my yard so big I got pet deers
And my homies try to act like I ain't real
I put my apron on, I taught myself how to make meals
You need a focus group, my group focused
Hit them loco jokers with the hocus pocus
I'm the dopest, you can quote this
Underscore, it's just me and dope
Dirty ass niggas, we'll sell your ass a ki of soap
I done seen them rich, I done seen them broke
I done seen it all, watched a pregnant lady smoke
When the baby come out, he gon' be geeked
You never know, he might come out to feed me Freedom, it's all I really want
It's all I really want to be
It's all I really need
I want, I want and I believe
You thought you had the best of me
But now I'm what you needNone
Heavenly Father, I wanna thank you for what you've done for me
In my life, I try so hard to be faithful, and I am faithful to you
And my soul just running away to you, and I want you to grab my hand and hold me
I know, I know, I know
One of these days, I'm gonna run away to you
Yes I am
Whoah, yes I am Make me wanna run away
Pack my bags and get away
On my knees at night, I pray
That we will live another day
You always got something to say In the kitchen with my kinfolk, cookin'
They say the devil always show up when you're not lookin'
That's why I'm doing God's work
I'll hook 'em with the scripture
Then bring it all to life so everyone can get the picture
I'm withcha 
See, this is for my folks who hold the fence up
The preachers, ministers, deacons, ushers and the sisters 
My granny used to say Give us our daily bread
She put it in my heart, and now it's in my head Make me wanna run away
Pack my bags and get away
On my knees at night, I pray
That we will live another day
You always got something to say I'm at the park, playin' ball with the children
Providing the league so I can help restore the feeling
It's a blessing to give back, so let's keep giving it
Walk by faith, and showing how we livin' it 
Lovin' it, avoiding the hate
Shout out to Ruth for giving birth to Nate
That's my homeboy's momma
We was raised in the Church
We take God with us
Do right, don't fight
Or try to squab with us
No weapon formed against me shall prosper
And that's fact, truth mane
The Gospel
Sittin' on the corner, tryna figure the fall
You done got too high, now you're feeling so low
I'm just a nobody, tryna tell everybody
About somebody who can save anybody
I remember what my Grandma said, Give us our daily bread
It's in my heart, and my head Make me wanna run away
Pack my bags and get away
On my knees at night, I pray
That we will live another day
You always got something to sayIntro:
Hope y'all make it through the storm
You know what though, I love the rain man
A lot of you cats are runnin' your mouths 
Your runnin' your mouths crazy

Niggas don't want beef they vegetarian
Scared of pussy you climbed out a caesarean 
I push ya grown ass back in your mother's womb

I'm in the streets like old graffiti
I'm hearin' wankstas talkin' greasy
Whether broke or rich my friend
Nasir bring that career to an end
And I'm bored with you MCs B
Y'all beneath me
And my raps bring horror like a board of Ouija
Of course I'm the king, get my shine on
And I blind y'all 'cause they call me The Lord of the Rings
Pinky heavy man, big stones in the wedding ban'
Smell of brimstone back from Hell again
Next verse gets worse from God's son to Devil sent Y'all need to take it slow
Don't body ya self
Motherfucker act like ya know 
Motherfucker better take it slow
Don't body ya self They say Jada defeated him
Joe too street for him
What's next? I guess it's for Nas to Ether him
Y'all awaiting an MC burial
This is ethereal, FM stereo to XM radio
What does it mean, ethereal? Hmm.. either heavenly or spiritual
Extreme, delicately light in a way that seems too perfect for this world
Man that is righteous, faithful and keeps law
Will surely live declares the sovereign Lord
And you are none of the above
So you a sucka for death, if I'm a sucka for love
And y'all wanna know why I don't gotta answer niggas
'Cause I truly understand these niggas
Scared of me so they talk about family members

First I get my money right, then I get my team on
If I always prayed to have gleam on
Three hundred dollar jeans on, do that mean I dream wrong?
And I was high as a Lear jet
Fly as the insect even though we in debt
And it don't matter if I get her number cause
When I get my money right, she gon' come running
And I be good like God with a extra o
God knows that my check needs some extra O's
And you know that you need to bring some extra
Not in jogging pants, either -- tell 'em wear some sexy clothes

And my eighth album comin'
Feeding a thousand growling stomachs
But I can rewind the calendar back
Back when it was now or nothin'
People said I would amount to nothin'
That I had talent for nothin'
Said I would succumb to violence or be silenced by a gunman
I could just hear the folks now, He got what he had comin'.
Now that my eighth album's comin' everybody's smilin'
Wanting somethin', claiming that they done somethin' for him
Got their Jay Z pom poms and their Hov uniform
Claiming they been runnin'
And tellin' everybody, like Martin Lawrence
'Bout how hot my rap performance was before I was who I was
Claiming that they threw it up before I threw it up
You what? Where was you before I blew this up?
I didn't see you in the courtroom when everybody was suin' us
I didn't see you in all black when everybody was suitin' up
Back on the block, getting it in, there wasn't no you with us 8 miles and runnin', got my seventh album droppin'
And my eighth album comin'
Feeding a thousand growling stomachs, Free!
6 miles and runnin', got my fifth strip poppin'

And my eighth album comin'
Feeding a thousand growling stomachs, Free!
6 miles and runnin', got my fifth strip poppin'
And my first album comin', feeding twenty growling stomachs 6 miles and runnin' in the Pontiac six thousand eighty six
Trans might shift while the engine run
Anyone tell your honor: Give me one more chance.
And them smokers screaming, One more gram!
So I'ma bring 'em one
Only son to my pop, stick close to my mama
Keep toasters for drama, make Salat with my son
My son growin' and he learnin' a lot
That's when them toasters, when the burners will pop
Brain on your, um–brella, a nigga, tell 'em niggas
That's like the Biblical scripture
Look back, turn to salt, like the sinners
Most of your heartless and self-centered
Like Meshach and Mesha
Set up your brother ‘cause you jealous, nigga
The heat back, like you never left
I ever rep, cops watch every step
Six miles and runnin', dodgin' every trap
The rap gingerbread man
Cherish every precious breath, state P the second gat 8 miles and runnin', got my seventh album droppin'

And my eighth album comin'
Feeding a thousand growling stomachs, Free!
6 miles and runnin', got my fifth strip poppin'
And my first album comin', feeding twenty growling stomachs Back when nobody would find he had talent
Nobody would sign me
Nobody believed in me, nobody but Mommy blindly
But how can she deny me? Me being the youngest runt
To come up outta her tummy, she got nothing but love for me
When niggas would one me, the industry shunned me
That's why I'm taking all the industry's money
Revenge is sweet honey, we run this
Young is the illest, Free is the future
Beans and Bleek is right now, we can see y'all 8 miles, nigga 8 miles and runnin', got my seventh album droppin'

Only concern is the next time, I'm gonna get me some
Know I should stay away from, cause it's no good for me
I try and try but my obsession won't let me leave I got a problem and I don't know what to do about it
Even if I did, I don't know if I would quit but I doubt it
I'm taken by the thought of it, and I know this much is true
Baby, you have become my addiction, I'm so strung out on you
I can barely move but I like it And it's all because of you
And it's all because of you
And it's all because of you
And it's all because...

Dreamed of you this morning
Then came the dawn, and
I thought you were here with me
If you could only see
How much I love you
That's all, that's all baby
Oh no-oh, I never gave up no way
I never, felt that before
Oh no-oh, I never gave up no way
I never, felt that before
Oh no-oh, I never gave up no way
I never, felt that before
But there's always; that's all, that's all baby Uhh, uhh!
This is the shit you dream about with the homies steaming out
Back-to-back, backing them Beemers out
Seems as our plans to get a grant
Then go off to college, didn't pan or even out
We need it now, we need a town
We need a place to pitch, we need a mound
For now, I'm just a lazy boy
Big dreaming in my La-Z-Boy
In the clouds of smoke, been playing this Marvin
Mama forgive me, should be thinking about Harvard
But that's too far away, niggas are starving
Nothing wrong with my aim, just gotta change the target
I got dreams of bagging snidd-ow, the size of pillows
I see pies every time my eyes clidd-ose
I see rides, sixes, I gotta get those
Life's a bitch, I hope to not make her a widow Oh no-oh, I never gave up no way
I never felt that before

Oh no-oh, I never gave up no way
I never felt that before

Oh no-oh, I never gave up no way
I never felt that before

But there's always, that's all, that's all baby Uh, uhhhh!
Now see the life's right there, and it seems right there
It's not quite near, and it's not like we're
Professionals, moving the decimals
Know where to cop? Nah! Got a connect? No!
Who in the F knows how to be successful
Need a Personal Jesus, I'm in Depeche Mode
They say its celestial, it's all in the stars
Like Tony La Russa on how you play your Cards
'Cause y'all ain't fucking with me! The ironies are
At all costs better avoid these bars
Now let's start, on your mark
Get set, let's go, get out the car
Going in circles it's a vicious cycle
This is a crash course, this ain't high school
Wake up Muttley, you're dreaming again
Your own reality show, the season begins Oh no-oh, I never gave up no way
I never felt that before

Oh no-oh, I never gave up no way
I never felt that before

Oh no-oh, I never gave up no way
I never felt that before

But there's always, that's all, that's all baby Step one in this process: scramble up in your projects
And head to the heights where big coke is processed
You gotta convince them that you're not from the precinct
Please speak slow 'cause he no speaky no English
If he takes a liking after a couple of trips
And your money is straight, he's going to give you consignment
You're now in a game where only time can tell
Survive the droughts, I wish you well - hold up
Survive the droughts? I wish you well?
How sick am I? I wish you health
I wish you wheels, I wish you wealth
I wish you insight so you could see for yourself
You could see the signs when the jackers is scheming
And the cops is coming, you could read they mind
You could see from behind, you could redefine
The game as we know it, one dream at a time
I'm, American dreamin' Oh no-oh, I never gave up no way
I never felt that before

Oh no-oh, I never gave up no way
I never felt that before

Oh no-oh, I never gave up no way
I never felt that before

But there's always, that's all, that's all baby American dreamin'
Yeah, I like it Love, let's talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for?
Or do the feeling haunt you? 
I know the feeling haunt you  This may be the night that my dreams all let me know
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
It may be the night that my dreams all let me know
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer Tell me what you gon' do to me
Confrontation ain't nothin' new to me
You can bring a bullet, bring a sword, bring a morgue
But you can't bring the truth to me
Fuck you and all your expectations
I don't even want your congratulations
I recognize your false confidence
And calculated promises all in your conversation
I hate people that feel entitled
Look at me crazy 'cause I ain't invite you
Oh, you important?
You the moral to the story? You endorsin'?
Mothafucka, I don't even like you
Corrupt a man's heart with a gift
That's how you find out who you dealin' with
A small percentage who I'm buildin' with
I want the credit if I'm losin' or I'm winnin'
On my momma, that's the realest shit Love, let's talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for?
Or do the feeling haunt you? 
I know the feeling haunt you  This may be the night that my dreams all let me know
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
It may be the night that my dreams all let me know
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer Love, let's talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for?
Or do the feeling haunt you? 
I know the feeling haunt you  This may be the night that my dreams all let me know
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
It may be the night that my dreams all let me know

I'm OBJ, hoes; break records like ankles
I've been that bitch since ice cream with the sprinkles
Tell 'em carry on, they gon' miss me when I'm gone
I'm gone Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I just fucked like five hoes in my mansion
Got 'em feelin' like they five star, yeah
Your hoes throwin' fits, my bitches patient
Man, I feel just like a doctor, yeah
Pop some X with my exotic dancer
She start cryin' and said her job hard, yeah
Switch her whip out, put her in a Mercedes
Now she screamin' Rest In Peace to Honda Cocaine on her navel, lick it so my tongue can go HAM
Put my face up in her pussy and my thumb in her ass
Make her do the jumpman, ayy
I put her face down in the pillow, 'bout to smother her ass
A fly yellow bone to me, I told her to come get a tan
Now she butter pecan
Oh, I got a Draco in the sofa, an Eggo in the toaster
A cradle in the chocha, the yayo doing yoga
And I wake up, smell the Folgers, I don't know how I woke up
'Cause I was in a coma, but now I'm in the moment
Wearing high socks on the front porch
Two cups with the mud flowin'
The plug ain't charge me nothin' for it
I cried tears of fuckin' joy
LVs on my luggage, boy
Don't ask me where I'm fuckin' goin'
I pull up with my skaters
Make 'em beat you with their fuckin' boards
Sharp shooters like pool sharks
Shoot you down in the Walmart
Shoot you down in the parkin' lot
Shoot you down in the food court
Hit your crib in the Steamboat
Then disappear on the speedboat
Act a jackass like Steve-O
Then disappear like Ne-Yo
Leave a red flag on your screen door
Leave a red flag around your queen's throat
Leave a blood stain on your mink floor
Like a red stain on clean snow
That money gang, 500 gang on that money train
And we walkin' around with bloody fangs
Playin' hunger games; mmm-yummy, man
And we storm the block, lightning and thunder came
When my youngest came, that's your mother's name
Hit the address, knockin' down picture frames and other things
Throwin' up Eastside like stomach pains
Sugarcane get took to Spain, a kilo fell and it shook the plane
A nigga screamed, the hoes wouldn't complain
I brought the AK with the knife, so the butcher came
And the Nina came, and her sister came
And what's her name, it’ll go Buka Bang
You don't even know where to put the blame, that's cold I just fucked like five hoes in my mansion
Got 'em feelin' like they five star
Your hoes throwin' fits, my bitches patient
Man, I feel just like a doctor
Pop some X with my exotic dancer
She start cryin' and said her job hard
Switch her whip out, put her in a Mercedes
Now she screamin' Rest in Peace to Honda Switch her whip out put her in a Mercedes
Now she screamin' Rest in Peace to Mazda
Put her ass up in a dumb Mercedes
Now she screamin' Rest in Peace to Smart Car
Switch her, put her in Mercedes
Now she screamin' Rest in Peace to Kia
Switch her whip out put her in a Mercedes
Now she screamin' Rest in Peace to Uber
That's some sick shit          
            Lyrics for this song have yet to be released. Please check back once the song has been released.
          
        A word from Hov Last night I performed at the University of Arizona, I had a ball!! Through all the excitement and joking around  so this will have to do.. Lovenot available
You cocked back
You thought you had it planned, you thought you had your man
He saw you comin', he ran when you tried to blast that man
You missed him by inches, he sprinted
Some of his boys on the corner was who your bullets entered
Two of 'em pull through, but one didn't, son's finished
You took the life of him
The part about it that's crazy, you was aiight with him
Tight with him, why was he in the way?
Why was he standin' next to the enemy that specific day?
His style never hollas loud, stays reclusive
Good dude, got that look like he always about to do shit
Side of his mouth toothpick, one eyebrow raised
Got into it with dude who still tried to live out his old wild out days
They never had no probs
Somehow they rubbed each other wrong like a bad massage
These two different personalities had to collide
Niggas could not aim and innocent niggas died
You ask why, cause of a Accident murderer, act like you killed on purpose
Liars brag, you put work in
You ain't mean to murk him, your gun's a virgin
Streets are full of them, read the bulletin
Accident murderer
You just a accident murderer We grew up doin' graffiti
Now hollows is gettin' heated
Seated in foreign cars, constantly gettin' weeded
Proceeded to count profits, I know they got on binoculars
But fuck 'em all, we ballin' 'til they come lock us up
Twenty to life, I'm clubbin' blowin' twenty tonight
We the Marlboro, Marley Marlin' all through the night
Addicted to wealth, never cold turkey to war
Snatch a tec off the shelf, live forever that's Insh'Allah
Memoirs of a rich nigga
Sweat suits, gold chains, old drug dealers
New Benz, chrome rims are for show, killer
You niggas accidental shoppers in back of the limo
Pay your tithes, stay alive, can't be dodgin' my clique
Hundred check, I use your bitch for some bargainin' chips
In a hole, sell your home nigga don't sell your soul
This forty-five in control, God forgives and I don't Accident murderer, accident murderer
You just an accident murderer Yo, for my nigga that got killed, got hit up
Vodka spills on the concrete, light a swisha, we miss ya
And for that girl who never made it home, shot in the dome
How they gon' kill that beautiful sista?
Violent adolescents, homicidal with weapons
Not a lot of knowledge inside of they minds, that I'm guessin'
Tell me who you impressin'?
Shooters I knew them when they was babies, I used to test them
Make 'em throw up they hands, choke 'em out playin' wrestlin'
Watch 'em grow to a man, I see them now they reppin'
But they cold-blooded, homie, wonderin' where the respect went
Can't play with these little niggas, gangsta little niggas
Can't hang with these little niggas, they killin', they reckless
Wish I could build with him, but will he change really?
Some real killers, I think of Wayne Perry
Fake 'til my nigga draws, what you want a name? Tell me
You ain't mean to kill him, it wasn't necessary Born on June 4th - the mind of a Gemini
Plight of a societal OutKast - Aquemeni
You bought a hammer just to silence the clamour
For another real G on the block, after your man got popped
When shots rang out, you ran for cover
Bought your first gun, spent a couple grand for another four
Told your mom you was preparing for war
She signed the shape of the cross each time you ran out the door
But you ain't never had the mind of a killer
You was more of an actor - with the movement of a small time dealer
When the feds came they got you for light work
Facing a few years, defence attorney told you it might work
To cop a plea and turn informant - you could save a few tenants
And at the same time reduce your sentence
You wore a wire to the home of your old supplier
And when they raided, you ain't make it - you was caught in the fire
Of an accident murderer Bittersweet, you're gonna be the death of me
I don't want you, but I need you,
I love you and I hate you at the very same time See what I want so much, should never hurt this bad
Never did this before, that's what the virgin says
We've been generally warned, that's what the surgeon says
God talk to me now this is an emergency And she claim she only with me for the currency
You cut me deep bitch, cut me like surgery
And I was too proud to admit that it was hurtin' me
I'd never do that to you at least purposely We breakin' up again
We makin' up again
But we don't love no more
I guess we fuckin' then Have you ever felt you want to kill her
And you mixed them emotions with Tequila
And you mix that with a little bad advice
On one of them bad nights you have a bad fight
And you talkin' about her family, her aunts and shit
And she say motherfucker your mama's a bitch
You know, domestic drama and shit
All the attitude
I'll never hit a girl but I'll shake the shit out of you But Ima be the bigger man
Big pimpin' like Jigga man
Oh I guess I figure it's Bittersweet,
You're gonna be the death of me
I don't want you, but I need you
I love you and I hate you at the very same time See what I want so much, should never hurt this bad
Never did this before, that's what the virgin says
We've been generally warned, that's what the surgeon says
God talk to me now this is an emergency And my niggas said I shouldn't let it worry me
I need to focus on the girls we getting currently
But I been thinking and it got me back to sinkin' it
this relationship even got me back to drinkin' and this Hennessy
Is gonna be the death of me
And I always thought that you havin' my child was our destiny
But I can't even vibe with you sexually
Coz every time that I try you will question me
Sayin', You fuckin' them girls, disrespectin' me?
You don't see how your lies is affecting me
You don't see how life was supposed to be
And I never let a nigga get that close to me
And you ain't cracked up to what you was supposed to be
You always gone, you always be where them hoes'll be.
And this the first time she ever spit her soul to me I fucked up and I know it G
I guess it's bittersweet poetry
Keep it 100, yeah, all day
Run on my niggas like all day
She fuck with the clique, yeah, all day
We take that money like all day

Swimmin' in the dirty Bay
Haters got no vertebrae
He ain’t real, he hella fake
Don't wanna see you elevate
Don't wanna see you levitate
Don't wanna see you escalate
Everyday we celebrate
Losers need to resignate
Misery loves company
Suckers wanna separate
Sippin' on this Hennessy
Meditate and medicate
Never Baller block and pass interference
40 thou for a guest apperance
I'm a cash cow, don't ask for none
Large lump sums, I ain't got no ones
When it's money involved, you know that I'm involved

My physique changed; yes I evolved
Closet lookin' like a shoppin' mall

Drawers spider, watch the 'rari crawl
Michael Jackson, yeah, I'm off the walls
Smilin' wild like I'm Pauly Wall
Ice barking like a million dogs

In America you'll never be free
Middle fingers up, fuck the police
Damn, can't a nigga just breathe?
Braveheart, still QB's Finest
Grinding, enough diamonds to change the climate
Not only do you see a nigga shining, you can see a nigga breathe
Jewels enchanted like they was new from Atlantis 
Cruise with the hammer, jealous heart, they can't stand him
Haters are scandalous, damn, can't a nigga just breathe? 
To all my niggas getting money in the streets 
Middle fingers up, fuck the police
Light up my trees, and I just breathe... I twist 'em, baby mama beef victim
Chronic leaf hitting, all kinds of heat with him, wisdom
From pot to piss in to high position
Intense hustle, it's pain like a pinched muscle
'Til it rains and my Timbs stain my socks
'Til I dodge enough shots, and the presiding judge slams a mallet
And says life I'ma guap, then I cop
Then I yacht, then I dock
Island hopping away from nightmare holders
Or cowboy slingers who shoot up any club
That see they names ring loud on some FBI poster
Must be on Ex or they coked up, suggesting I post a
Bail, I'm like yes, 'cause we soldiers
We just getting older, in time, we still in our prime
I can't afford a new arrest on my folder
 In America you'll never be free
Middle fingers up, fuck the police
Damn, can't a nigga just breathe?
Braveheart, still QB's Finest
Grinding, enough diamonds to change the climate
Not only do you see a nigga shining, you can see a nigga breathe
Jewels enchanted like they was new from Atlantis 
Cruise with the hammer, jealous heart, they can't stand him
Haters are scandalous, damn, can't a nigga just breathe? 
To all my niggas getting money in the streets 
Middle fingers up, fuck the police 
Light up my trees, and I just breathe... I'm, fresh out of city housing, ain't have too many options
Pennies on a pension or penitentiary bounded
Plenty Henny in me, envy was simply they trend, see
My enemy was every hater that was bigger than me
The high life, the fly life
Pierre Hardy, imitation of Christ
Ice-wear gaudy, since '94 flossy
The Lex was an excellent choice, now fast forward me
The pestilence of the ghetto informed me
As a shorty, to push nothing less than a 740
With fresh linen, sip Pellegrinos with Airs on
They sick, mixing they water with Airborne Oh, they so sick!
Look how I got 'em going crazy, look at that!
You gotta let it out, stress...ain't good man
You gotta breathe 
And America, we gotta be free
Breathe...
Breathe...
Breathe...
Breathe...
I got, I got, I got, I got— Loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA Cocaine quarter piece, got war and peace inside my DNA I got power, poison, pain and joy inside my DNA I got hustle though, ambition flow inside my DNA I was born like this, since one like this, immaculate conception I transform like this, perform like this, was Yeshua new weapon I don't contemplate, I meditate, then off your fucking head This that put-the-kids-to-bed This that I got, I got, I got, I got— Realness, I just kill shit 'cause it's in my DNA I got millions, I got riches buildin' in my DNA I got dark, I got evil, that rot inside my DNA I got off, I got troublesome heart inside my DNA I just win again, then win again like Wimbledon, I serve Yeah, that's him again, the sound that engine in is like a bird You see fireworks and Corvette tire skrrt the boulevard I know how you work, I know just who you are See, I was, I was, I was—
Cruising down the street when you were high on table tops
Dressing up like a damn idiot and fucking all those mops
Switching flows just like my hoes and no one ever told me stop
No one ever told me “Stop this shit, before I call the cops”
I just win again, and win again
There ain’t no misconception
All them other hoes who wanted dick was fucking, no exceptions
She destroying shit and killing shit with her only damn weapon
This shit is so crazy, I might give you a damn lesson I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA

Reminiscing about the Fresh Fest back in '85
When the dubs and the San Dieg's used to hoo ride
On motherfuckers like it was the thing to do
Eighty-five, eighty-fo', eight-three, and year eighty-two 
You know what the fuck I'm talking about
After party on the lake at the big homie's house

Puffing on a fat ass J, with my homie named Tray

Back together like it was supposed to see Cause ya know I'm down with ya, to make 'em get the picture
And if I have to sit ya, down then I spit ya
Game from the heart, I came from the start
See I was regulating, when Cragars was the Daytons Nigga let me interact with my black croaker sacks*
And a gray golf hat tilted to the back 
Ditchin' Sunday school to get a pack of Now and Laters
While I'm rolling with the Steelers and killin' with the raiders And when we bang with the Saints then we ain't no joke
Come around from outta bounds and we goes for broke Now we're breaking 'em up 
And just for a second we're waking 'em up
 Giving up game on this tight ass beat
With a small dedication, to two-one street
Snoop Dogg
They wonder how I do it, that's that big boy shit
5-7 clean, that's that big boy whip
State Seattles mean, that's them big boy kicks
The way I mack at a bitch, that's the big boy spit
King of the coach, yeah, I earned my due
Pimp hoes, pimp clothes, yeah, I earned that shoe
Been around the world, did my time in the pen
Niggas in gangbangs is back on them swings
So how could you ever disrespect my place?
Since '93 strong I was all in your face
Big shows in arenas, bitches picker than Trina
Party like rock stars at the bars where I seen her
Made my move closely, you owe me
I had you in the club for 10 years sipping slowly
To my shit classics and all it was was keeping it true
I brought the west back, what did you do?  Ain't nobody better than me
True hood rock star in me
Ain't nobody better than me
S-S-N-double O-E Slow motion in the fast lane
Feeling so alone blowing domes in the crap game
Sitting at the top of the game where you ain't
Got every type of car so now I just play the paint
Show after show, bank row in the Rolls
Living nice, big slice, got me slamming cans a doors
Three piece suit with a pocket watch
Snoop comin on, you all riding chrome like you gotta stop soon
Did it the G way, he say, she say
Peer pressure to me, way to stop, bang in the seat way
I was the hog in the streets
Got in the game and broke the law on these beats
The slow flow killed and people said I rapped like I was chilling
Way above the stars, Snoop Dogg is top feeling
Plastics and all it was was keeping it true
I brought the west back, what did you do? 
You just in it, nigga, I run it
I gave life to the game and you behind on your bills
Like I can't get in your grill 'cause I live in the hills
Snoopie this, Snoopie that, yeah, I heard what you said
Ungrateful ass nigga, all the kids that I've fed
Young ass buster, let me see your ID
I just chunked up a bill passing VIP
I gave niggas a lane to represent that G-A-N-G-S-T-A on me
Been crippin', been pimpin', been doing the do
See me walking and that whole world doing it too
They play follow the leader, boss on the move
Shot down to the shoes, man I brunk on shoes
Cotis at the mall, I've been keeping it truth
I brought the west back, what the fuck did you do, nigga?

But I ain't with the hard talk
I got a monopoly, catch me on my boardwalk
Like I said we pull your card and find out you're a Hallmark
Just know I'm breakin' world records, no false start
I don't see your point unless it's gunpoint or somethin'
My deal like Weezy first week, one point somethin'
And my verses gettin' stupider
Wayne if you're on Mars, can you pick me up from Jupiter?
Phone blowin' up, so I'm cuttin' off my cellular
I'm a superstar, noted on to my nebula
I will break a leg, break an arm and a fibula
When I break it down, when I, when I break it down
I hug and kiss the drum kick
I put the beat in my back pocket and just sit
But, you could never beat my ass, pause
Again, dammit y'all, again
Y'all, pretend that we are, some men that get it on, and in
I'll die before I lose, 'cause I was born, to win
If he don't fuck with y'all, then don't bother him
And yes, I fuck this game but I won't father them
Right, uh It's like, these days man, I'm booked and I'm busy
Dad named me Drake, Footz named me Drizzy
They tried to tell me I'd never be nothin' but a protege
But if you watched the VMAs, there's nothing more to say
I got the key to happiness and all the copies
Remember this day like you bought a poppy
And damn, how I get so nice?
I just spent it all once, 'bout to get rich twice
Surprise party bitch, now it's on and poppin'
I always choose dough like it's my only option
'Cause money always knows best
Chain snatch flow, they say Get it off your chest
And I'm what all the fuss about
And if they talkin', I bet I'm what they discussion 'bout
Hit me at the office, same extension
Consider me the reason y'all should pay attention
Yeah
I want all my niggas to come journey with me
My name is Nas, and the year is 1973
Beginning of me, therefore I could see
Through my belly button window who I am... I existed in a womb, just like an abyss
Came straight from spirit land, my hands balled in a fist
Punching on my moms stomach, kicking on her cervix
Twitching cause I'm nervous
Thought my intended purpose
Was to be born to reign, not in scorn or vain
But to take on a name, my pops chose for me
Bloodstream full of indo
Developing eyes
Looking out my belly button window
My father's size
On his face he wears a frown
And I'm wondering if they even want me around
Cause I'll go back to spirit town
So I could rest longer before I come back down
The chute again, in the near future when
My moms and pops can agree on this
Was here before but my moms saw her gynocologist
He dumped me off, first they want me then turn around and they dont
You got 120 days do what you want
But as for me coming back this be my last time
Abort me, keep me, give me away, make up ya mind I shot my way out my mom dukes
I shot my way out my mom dukes They must wanna keep me, cause 4 months past and I'm still alive
Guess I got what you call an ill-will to survive
When I look hard the lights is killing my eyes
I know when moms is laying down cause I get bored and start to get live
Move side to side hear loud music and vibe
All black babies are born with rhythm thats no lie
Solar energize, mineralize food through my mothers tube
I'm covered in this thick layer of goo
Month two was the least most comfortable
My umbilical cord choking me
But month 3 was closer, see
Thats when pops took moms to see the doc at the clinic
But I was saved cause he changed his mind in the last minute
Watching 'em yell, heard my moms voice well
Feared fist fights, so terrified when we fell
While they broke up furniture and smashed plates on the wall
I wondered if I am born will I be safe at all
This place they call the world through my view was so large
Couldn't wait to get up, grow up and take charge
Month 5, Month 6 went by, hoping I'm born in July
But the Lord already figured out a date and time
Septemeber 14th, '73
Get ready world, doctors in the front waiting for me
Arms open cause they know when I drop, alot of shit's gonna stop
See how the goverment will start re-training cops
Month 9, I'm a week over due, the labor induced
Pops told my moms to push and take deep breaths too
Said stay calm, holding her arm, I'm trying to hold on
Surgical gloves touching my scalp, my head pops out
Everything blurry, my first breath screams out
Tears pouring down my pops face he's so proud
Wanted to hold me, but I was so bloody
They washed me off and he said At least that nigga ain't ugly!
Placed me in his arms snuggly, laid me on my mother
Finally, I got to see who held me in her body
She loved me,and I plan to overthrow the devil
Y'all bout to see this world in trouble
Motherfuckers...
Bittersweet
You're gonna be the death of me
I don't want you, but I need you
I love you and hate you at the very same time
Bittersweet See, what I want so much should never hurt this bad
Never did this before, that's what the virgin says
We've been generally warned, that's what the surgeon says
God, talk to me now, this is an emergency
And she claims she only with me for the currency
You cut me deep, bitch, cut me like surgery
And I was too proud to admit that it was hurting me
I'd never do that to you, at least purposely
We breaking up again, we making up again
But we don't love no more, I guess we fucking then
Have you ever felt you ever want to kill her?
And you mix them emotions with tequila
And you mix that with a little bad advice
On one of them bad nights, y'all have a bad fight
And you talk about her family, her aunts and shit
And she say, Motherfucker, your momma's a bitch
You know, domestic drama and shit, all the attitude
I'd never hit a girl, but I'll shake the shit out of you
But I'mma be the bigger man, big pimpin' like Jigga man
Oh, I guess I figure it's Bittersweet
You're gonna be the death of me
I don't want you, but I need you
I love you, hate you at the very same time
Bittersweet See, what I want so much should never hurt this bad
Never did this before, that's what the virgin says
We've been generally warned, that's what the surgeon says
God, talk to me now, this is an emergency
And my niggas said I shouldn't let it worry me
I need to focus on the girls we getting currently
But I been thinking and it got me back to sinking
And this relationship, it even got me back to drinking
Now this Hennessy, uh, it's gonna be the death of me
And I always thought that you having my child was our destiny
But I can't even vibe with you sexually
'Cause every time that I'd try, you would question me
Saying, You fucking them girls, disrespecting me
You don't see how your lies is affecting me?
You don't see how our life was supposed to be?
And I never let a nigga get that close to me
And you ain't cracked up to what you were supposed to be
You always gone, you always be where them hoes will be
And this the first time she ever spilled her soul to me Bittersweet 
You're gonna be the death of me 
I don't want you, but I need you
I love you and hate you at the very same time
Bittersweet
You're gonna be the death of me
I don't want you, but I need you
I love you and hate you at the very same time See, what I want so much should never hurt this bad
Never did this before, that's what the virgin says
We've been generally warned, that's what the surgeon says
God, talk to me now, this is an emergency
See, what I want so much should never hurt this bad
Never did this before, that's what the virgin says
We've been generally warned, that's what the surgeon says
God, talk to me now, this is an emergency Bittersweet
You're gonna be the death of me
I don't want you, but I need you
I love you and hate you at the very same time
(Bittersweet
You're gonna be the death of me
I don't want you
...very same time)
Show them how to break they ankles, mayne
Yeah, E-40 and Shawty Lo Hey, let's go
From the West Coast to Atlanta
If a nigga gonna hate, well, got damn 'em
Hey! Go on an' break ya ankles
Hit the dance floor
Go on an' break ya ankles
Go stupid, get retarded

Wake the game up, them boys made it

Hey, gonna break ya ankles
We be the shit yaddamean
Go on an' break ya ankles This a boy, this thang slap
I brought the whole hood with me, brought the whole trap
Mama, this your song, you know the lyrics
Go on an' break ya ankles, yeah, that's the spirit
Go nutty, go bananas, go berserk
Show them how to do it, let me see your foot work
We runnin' up a tab, havin' money so we spend it
Bottles everywhere, celebrating like we won the pennant
You recognize the fixture, you see the brightling watch
You get the big picture, you know that I'm a boss
(I'mma show up, I'mma show out
From the West Coast to the Dirty South) Fresh off tour, I brought a mil' with me
Now the whole club gonna have to deal with me
Like Three 6, tear the club up
Like Pac-Man, cause I don't give a fuck
I'm throwing big bucks, cash everywhere
Shawty over here, 40 over there
You know the broads out cause the stars out
You see the parking lot, we brought the cars out
We going stupid, get retarded
And we ain't playin' with 'em, we came to party
I brought a lot of dough, I'm steady throwin' singles
So hit the dance floor, so go on an' break ya ankles Do it like this, do it like that
Do it like this, then you do it like that
Break it on down, show 'em how to clown
Mean mug with it, let me see you rep your town
All street money, bonafide trapper
Never seen a check, ballin' like a rapper
80 on the arm, a hunnit on my neck
Shoe game sick, in the Bay we call it wet
More jewelry than the court room, glowin' like the moon
More jewelry than the court room, I'mma tycoon
Designer everything, throw it in the bag
I don't know how much it costs, I don't look at price tags 
I had to hand-wash my clothes, didn't have a washing machine or a dryer
Momma used to have to hang her period panties out on a clothes line wire
The vacuum broke, used the broom
We got company coming over this afternoon
You know our family like to gossip
Clean up your room, throw everything in the closet'
I like to talk to the old schoolers, O.G. playas
Cause they was my age - I ain't never been theirs
I count on em for guidance, leadership and advice
Cause everything I'm goin' through they done been through twice
Or three or four times, five, six, seven, eight
We can learn from they mistakes before it's too late
Communication is everything, conversation's abandoned
People die every day because of misunderstandings
The ins and outs, whys and won'ts
History repeats itself, opportunities don't
Sad true story, unintentionally, not on purpose
Only time I see my family's at a funeral service
Her stomach keep hurting, but she didn't bother
Cause you and I both know that black folk don't like to go to the doctor
One thing about us, mane, we creators
And at the end of the day we all related
Through the slaves and the Indians and natives
They brought us here on a boat, whipped us and raped us
Scraps from a pig they gave us
So we grub pork chops, chitlins, ribs and bacon
Choppa kinda old, but a new clip
Shoot your ass, put yo ass on a news clip
Hope her two lips smell like tulips
Put you in the ground right next to the tulips
Nigga talkin' shit on the other side
Tell that pussy nigga I pull up
Used to sell work to his aunt, he ain't push weight
Nigga did pull ups
By the time ya look up, nigga done cook up
When you turn away, a nigga done took her
Got her in the suite, looking like a hooker
Jumpin' on the bed like Jimmy Fly Snuka
I take her to the mall and I pocketbook her
You tryna' spend time, nigga probably book her
Yeah, I'm tryna' fuck her, fuck her like I used to
I don't believe in karma, but I believe in Kama Sutra
Put one leg on the other leg
Then I skate away like Winnipeg
And I'm through fucking with these lame niggas

Got a dope spot called Escobar

Time has come so I guess I'll just retire
Destroying you obviously was not my desire... I never really cared what you said
Never thought that you'd change
Now I'm left all alone and you're far away
Guess you finally found a way to run away Am I okay? Am I drowning in pain?
And all this hate is driving me insaine
Am I okay? Am I drowning in pain?
And all this hate is driving me insaneThis is special, man. As my guy Mozzy say, you know, God up top all the time—real talk, you know. Hip-hop, man. I said hip-hop. This is a special award because of rap music. This is the thing that got me on the stage. This got me to tour all around the world, support my family and all that. Most importantly it showed me a true definition of what being an artist was. From the jump I thought it was about the accolades and the cars and the clothes. But it’s really about expressing yourself and putting that paint on the canvas for the world to evolve for the next listener, the next generation after that, you know what I’m saying? Hip-hop has done that for me. I got a lot of guys in this building right now that I still idolize to this day: Jay-Z, Nas, Puff, you know. These guys showed me the game through their lyrics, from close and from afar. So with that being said, this trophy to hip-hop, real talk. That’s love, baby. Jay for president!

This for the town, nigga Me, I'm from the Hub City, yeah, that Compton court building
Caught a murder when his homie died, judge caught feelings
I'm on Rosecrans, chilling right inside Best Outlest
Five dollar Little Caesar, momma shopped at Food-4-Less
Elementary McNair, say what's up to Vanguard
Centennial High, had me swimming with a pool of sharks
Me, I'm just a good kid, tryna keep it neutral
But I'm well aware that a square can get shot too
Most Crip and some Piru, that's just how the game go
Hood on every corner, stop for gas and get your brains blown
Bitches with fat asses, burning in the stashes
Murders in July, call that summer time madness
Rest in peace 4 Bent, rest in peace Mausberg
Swear to God, when I make it big, your voice'll be heard
Me, I'm just a good kid, tryna keep it positive
Though I know it's chaos, forever my heart will live in Compton, concrete jungle
Where dreams are made of
There's nothing you can't do
Now you're in Compton
These streets will make you or break you
Expire or inspire you
Let's hear it for Compton
Compton, Compton 
Take you back to Y.E.T it was just divining me
Earl had got disciplined for not catching a fade that week
Shit had made him stronger though, yeah those were the good old days
Eating Tam's burger while my Juvenile CD had played
21 outside maybe sideline pop
Yellow tape on sidewalk damn somebody got popped
Hoping that I live a lot, I don't want to die young
Please don't come shoot up my party, I just want to have fun
Sheriffs in my rear view, mother fuck the police
Pull me over just to plant an 8 ball on me
Fuck it though I'm out here, I've always been out here
Since the Compton swap meet, black and red LA gears
Pac was on Rosecrans nigga I was right there
Cali Love video he said whattup I said yeah
Free my nigga J-Dub and both of the J-Mans
Eazy paved the way, Lil Eazy bout to get it in for..

[My nigga Hootie told me to keep it Compton, keep it Compton yeah
E-S-T 1987, Dominguez Hospital that bitch was on Bullis Road]
The ghetto Othello, the Moor
Oh my God, they speak venomous on the boy
Oh my Lord, my enemy is fear, and I'm sure
Oh my God, they want the end of me 'cause I'm pure
Oh my Lord, discipline for the win, I just go for it
It's a trend for these men to die on their own sword
Journey far, learn who you can be
But you can learn who you are when you around family
Chip off their shoulders and soldiers, on they grizzle
My granddaddy Mack Little married Nannie Little
They passed down wisdom, blessings were given
Pray my sins don't get passed to my children
I made a killin', I'm alive like the morning star
Court Jordan's for the price on stock, so what the Hornets are?
I need evaluations, I'm savvy, y'all
Eatin' foie gras and caviar, listen Adam and Eve
Don't fall too far from the apple tree, ayy
Adam and Eve, Adam and Eve
Don't fall too far from the apple tree, apple tree The ghosts of gangsters dance
Chinchillas shake on the hanger, the force of this banger
Yeah, my language advanced, my cadence amazin'
The voice triggers somethin', what is this conundrum?
The clouds scurry, your spirit rumble, a boyish smile
Still puff the loud, it's nothin' less than a quarter pound
Savage narrative, every verse that I write bursts light
Brings awareness to my personal life
After my morning walk, Havana cigar, the ganja spark
See my doctor more, sweat in the sauna or the spa
Spendin' fifty large at the Bellagio
Spent twenty on a bad bitch I hardly know
New girl every night, two girls was every other night
Sexual addiction, gangster tradition
They wanna fuck me, have me under they belt, slightly offended
Yeah, that's how I felt, that's how it ended
I'm just good at existin', existin' in my truth
As long as I enjoy the fruit, yeah Adam and Eve
Don't fall too far from the apple tree, ayy
Adam and Eve, Adam and Eve
Don't fall too far from the apple tree, apple tree What come first, peace or the paper?
Before I had a piece of paper, peace was in my favor
Before I sat to eat at the table, it had leeches and traitors
Cut the fat from the meat, extract the weak, bon appetit
No bacon, brothers is swine
It's so hard to trust 'em 'cause my hustle is mine
It's evident they all the same, with gray hair and still mean muggin'
Gray hairs of wisdom, that means you seen somethin'
Say somethin', you stay frontin'
But these clowns got false crowns, fictitional kings
You broke my heart, Fredo
You bring this thing of ours down to a fable
Be advised my guys dyin', enterprisin' at a boss's table
There's always room at my table
Insecurities is keepin' you disabled
All this money to get, is it less time?
They ain't stopped printin' money, 'cause they made mine
I learned to stretch time, these are the best times
I'm in my neighborhood in stadiums, the Mets' kind
With restaurants and Carbone, spicy rigatoni
Go hard, a red Bordeaux, oh God Adam and Eve
Don't fall too far from the apple tree, ayy
Adam and Eve, Adam and Eve
Don't fall too far from the apple tree, apple tree
Ayo, blast that shit, Maxx

And my haters either on they way to work or they arrived
And I gotta own the things I rap about just for my pride
You know when it comes to pride, I can't put that shit aside
I've been kicked when I was down
None of that shit matter now

Everything will be okay

Waiting on a dream that'll never come true
Didn't you know, I was waiting on you

Channel cruiseDisick: Hey, do you like Kanye West? Cheban: Yeah, he's okay, I guess D: Well, the early work was a little too hip-hop for me in my taste, but when Dark Twisted Fantasy came out in 2010, I think he really came into his own, both musically and lyrically D: Kanye's been compared to Jesus, Hitler, Walt Disney, and even Steve Jobs C: Hey Disick D: Yes Jonathan? C: Why do you have copies of Billboard magazine all over the place? Do you have a little dog - a little chow or something? *laughs* D: No, Jonathan! C: Is that a raincoat? D: Yes, it is! Now, Kanye's decided to release this, Yeezus, his most exciting record so far. It should be obvious by now that New Slaves is the undisputed masterpiece of Yeezus. A song so catchy, most people won't even remember the lyrics! But they should. And then there's the song I Am a God. The title practically speaks for itself, but of course the insecurities of the mainstream music press will never understand its true meaning because it's about me! Hey Jonathan! D: Try getting the Yeezus album now motherfucker!

I don't know you, I can't tell your energy is dangerous
You don't know how long it took to finally come alive
So bitch don't kill my vibe
Yeah, I can feel the changes, and I can tell you hating
Save your breath I'm sick to death of fake congratulations
You don't know how much I had to give to come alive
So what, So what?, So bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe Look inside of my soul
And you can find gold and maybe get rich
Look inside of your soul and you can find out it never exist
I can feel the changes, I can feel a new life
I always knew life can be dangerous
I can say that I like a challenge and you to me is painless
You don't know what pain is
How can I paint this picture when the color blind is hanging with you
Fell on my face and awoke with a scar
Another mistake living deep in my heart
Wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick
I can admit that it did look like yours
Why you resent every making of this?
Tell me your purpose is petty again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge
Even a small lighter can burn a bridge I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me
Then put me on stages, to me that's amazin'
To you that's a quick check
With all disrespect, let me say this I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
Lord forgive me, Lord forgive me things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it but today I'm yelling
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe I'm trying to keep it alive and not compromise the feeling we love
You're trying to keep it deprived and only co-sign what radio does
And I'm looking right past you
We live in a world, we live in a world on two different axles
You live in a world, you living behind the mirror
I know what you scared of, the feeling of feeling emotions inferior
This shit is vital, I know you had to
This shit is vital, I know you had to
To die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain
Is way more believable, give me a feasible gain
Rather a seasonal name, I'll let the people know this is something you can blame
On yourselves you can remain stuck in a box
I'm a break out and then hide every lock
I'm a break out and then hide every lock I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me
Then put me on stages, to me that's amazin'
To you that's a quick check
With all disrespect, let me say this I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
Lord forgive me, Lord forgive me things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it but today I'm yelling
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
You ain't heard the Coast like this in a long time
Don't you see that long line?
And they waiting on Kendrick like the first and the fifteenth
Threes in the air, I can see you are in sync
Hide your feelings, hide your feelings
Now what you better do
I'll take your girlfriend and put that pussy on a pedestal
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
Walk out the door and they scream it's alive
My New Year's resolution is to stop all the pollution
Talk too motherfuckin' much, I got my drink, I got my music
I say bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
I know it's gon' be a lotta conversation after tonight. Khaled, I love you, I know you got killers in Miami, please do not send 'em at my head, I just wanna have a conversation about how you playing radio's game. Khaled, you a real nigga. Khaled, you a real nigga, you got the keys. But as we learn all the politics, and niggas was doing for years, Obama couldn't make America great, because he couldn't be him, to be who he was.
Black men have been slaves, Obama wasn't allowed to do this, *screech*, and still win. He had to be perfect, but being perfect don't always change shit bro. Being perfect don't always change shit bro.
So when I'm talking about MTV -- Let me explain something. I was hurt. Beyonce, I was hurt because I wanted to present a video called Famous, and out of respect, MTV told me Mr. West, I don't respect you. I will let you know that Beyonce is winning the video tonight, for formation, over Hotline Bling and Famous. They told me beforehand so I wouldn't run on stage. Ay bruh, y'all ain't gotta fuck with me, but you know I got the vision, and you know I'mma keep it real with you.
Beyonce, I was hurt, I went down 7 years on behalf of yo --
Ay nigga, don't throw no shit when I'm talkin'!
I am putting my career, my life, my public well standing, at risk when I talk to y'all like this. This is the moment in the Matrix, bro, the  is back!
Motherfuckers might feel a way about this tonight. Beyonce, I was hurt, 'cause I heard that you said you wouldn't perform unless you won Video Of The Year over ME, and over Hotline Bling.  In my opinion -- Now don't go trying to diss Beyonce. She is great. Taylor Swift is great. We are all great people. We are all equal. But sometimes, we be playing the politics too much, and forgetting who we are, just to win. Fuck winning. Fuck looking cool. Fuck looking cool. Fuck being cool. Fuck all that, bruh!
I been sitting here, to give y'all my truth, even at the risk of my own life. Even at the risk of my own success. My own career. I been sitting here, to give y'all the truth. JAY Z, call me bruh. You still ain't called me!
JAY Z call me, Ay bruh, I know you got killers, don't send 'em at my head! Just call me! Talk to me like a man.
I'm trying to be THE man, I just am A man. The same as everybody in here. I ain't above, below, none of y'all. We all equal. We all equal. These are the vibes, bro. This is the future. This is the way of thinking to Make America Great Again. Hahaha, ayo, you like that. Guess what? Guess what? Y'all need the vibes. I was hurt, feelings matter. The way motherfuckers put money up so high, popularity, radio spins, feelings matter bruh. Feelings matter bruh. It's a new world, Hillary Clinton. It's a new world. Feelings matter. 'Cause guess what? Everybody in middle-America felt a way, and they showed you how they felt. Feelings matter, bruh. It's a new world. It's a new world, Barrack. It's a new world, JAY Z. Ay, don't send killers at my head, this ain't the Malcom X movie, we growing from that moment. Let 'Ye be 'Ye. Oh wait a second, do y'all agree with that? Let 'Ye be 'Ye! Wait a second, I ain't hearing no screams on that. Let 'Ye be 'Ye. People, I'm not saying this out of my own well being, because it wouldn't be smart out of my own well being to say things like this. Radio, I done talked to you a bunch of motherfucking times. Y'all motherfuckers is behind the times. Because guess what? The Saint Pablo tour is the most relevant shit happening.**Lyrics from Snippet** Damn, lost in the abyss

I will not fall for the go-around
But what comes around, bitch, goes around
Karma's a bitch, and God has an ugly frown
I know that first-hand, inside, you will too, too, too
You will catch smoke by the second hand
The cancer is coming to you, you, you Time is up, time is up, time is up, and time is up

Did you realize
That you were a champion in their eyes? Yes I did
So I packed it up and brought it back to the crib
Just a little something, show you how we live
Everybody want it but it ain't that serious
Mhm, that's that shit
So if you gon' do it, do it just like this Did you realize
That you were a champion in their eyes? You don't see just how wild the crowd is
You don't see just how fly my style is
I don't see why I need a stylist
When I shop so much I can speak Italian
I don't know, I just want it better for my kids
And I ain't sayin' we was from the projects
But every time I wanted layaway or a deposit
My dad'd say when you see clothes, close your eyelids
We was sort of like Will Smith and his son
In the movie, I ain't talkin' 'bout the rich ones
Cause every summer, he'd get some
Brand new harebrained scheme to get rich from
And I don't know what he did for dough
But he'd send me back to school with a new wardrobe Did you realize
That you were a champion in their eyes? I think he did
When he packed it up and brought it back to the crib
Just a little somethin', show you how we live
Everything I wanted, man it seem so serious
Mhm, that's that shit
So if you gon' do it, do it just like this Did you realize
That you were a champion in their eyes? When it feel like living's harder than dyin'
For me givin' up's way harder than tryin'
Lauryn Hill said her heart was in Zion
I wish her heart still was in rhymin'
'Cause who the kids gon' listen to, huh?
I guess me if it isn't you
Last week I paid a visit to the institute
They got the dropout keepin' kids in the school
I guess I cleaned up my act like Prince'd do
If not for pleasure, then at least for the principle
They got the CD, they got to see me
Drop gems like I dropped out of PE
They used to feel invisible
Now they know they invincible Did you realize
That you were a champion in their eyes? This is the story of a champion
Runners on their mark and they pop their guns
Stand up stand up here he comes
Tell me what it takes to be number one
Tell me what it takes to be number one
This is the story of a champion
Runners on their mark and they pop their guns
Stand up stand up here he comes
Tell me what it takes to be number one
Tell me what it takes to be number one Did you realize
That you were a champion in their eyes? Yes I did
So I packed it up and brought it back to the crib
Just a little somethin', show you how we live
Everybody want it, but it ain't that serious
Mhm, that's that shit
So if you gon' do it, do it just like this... like this Did you realize
That you were a champion in their eyes? Greetings loved ones

My nigga DJ Clue - put this shit on these niggas
Desert Storm baby 2000! A Drug dealers dream - flip his last Ki out the game
Cause entertainment money now is off the chain
I put blunts in niggas caskets, lost in the game
I learned about pain, bodies burnt in drug game
But I'm neva gon' die, I neva heard of death
Energy could neva be destroyed
Only the flesh, when you niggas try to murder me
With bullets to my head
This is my you can't kill me niggas
I'm already dead, BRING IT!!
I'm busting bodies fall in the cemetery
Black blood raining on the street
All you niggas, buried y'all
Niggas just came home, fresh out the state greens
Five time felon, thinking he jelling in Queens
It's pitiful - what bid could do, especially federal
Y'all young thugs wilding, see prison
Got a bed for you waiting, I clapped that Satan
But thought I was dreaming
I woke up masturbating in the bed with demons
I cried with every bit of strength of my small body
This is the life I chose, under God I'm tiny
Hard to find me, I popped up, lock shot-up
You can't B.I., see I'm eternal, not luck
You get shot-up, boxed-up next for the grave
Your flow is one dimensional, your level is 2nd grade
You're on top -- WHAT?
Copy and fuck, I said it first, you repeated
Your false crown covered in dirt - defeated
Y'all niggas all hail, the King is dead
He running like a bitch with his tail between his legs
'Stillmatic', still eye 4 an eye, wanna be God
You're just the next rapper to die, fucking with Nas
Gangsta Grillz

Like Jackie Gleason on his honeymoon
What up Fuke? Hot Spitter in the building
Young Money in the arena
Ya catch me with two bad bitches between us

With the wind against my back I defend in the attack
By any man I’m in fact, ha ha
And its like that
My impact so hard if I die
I probably bounce right back
I walk around with a mice trap
Niggas wit cheese don’t like rats
And despite that
I been around a few gold fish
I’m still a shark out the ocean
I wear the fuck out the 0 6, 4 sent flow

Ayo, I know you ain't talkin' about me, dog
You? What?!)
Fuck Jay Z!
(You been on my dick, nigga
You love my style, nigga)
Fuck Jay Z!  Fuck with your soul like ether
 Teach you – the king – you know you
 God's Son across the belly
 I prove you lost already Brace yourself for the main event, y'all impatiently waitin'
It's like an AIDS test, what's the results? Not positive
Who's the best: Pac, Nas and B.I.G.? Ain't no best
East, West, North, South, flossed out, greedy
I embrace y'all with napalm
Blows up, no guts left, chest/face gone
How could Nas be garbage? Semi-autos at your cartilage
Burner at the side of your dome, come out of my throne!
I got this locked since 9-1, I am the truest
Name a rapper that I ain't influenced
Gave y'all chapters, but now I keep my eyes on the Judas
With Hawaiian Sophie fame, kept my name in his music  Fuck with your soul like ether
 Teach you – the king – you know you
 God's Son across the belly
 I prove you lost already Ayo, pass me the weed!
Put my ashes out on these niggas, man
Ayo, you faggots, y'all kneel
And kiss the motherfuckin' ring!  Fuck with your soul like ether
 Teach you – the king – you know you
 God's Son across the belly
 I prove you lost already I've been fucked over, left for dead, dissed and forgotten
Luck ran out, they hoped that I'd be gone, stiff and rotten
Y'all just piss on me, shit on me, spit on my grave
Talk about me, laugh behind my back, but in my face
Y'all some well-wishers, friendly-acting, envy-hiding snakes
With your hands out for my money, man, how much can I take?
When these streets keep callin', heard it when I was sleep
That this Gay-Z and Cock-a-Fella Records wanted beef
Started cockin' up my weapon, slowly loadin' up this ammo
To explode it on a camel and his soldiers
I can handle this for dolo, and his manuscript just sound stupid
When KRS already made an album called Blueprint 
First Biggie's your man, then you got the nerve to say
That you better than B.I.G
Dick-suckin' lips, why don't you let the late great veteran live? I… will… not… lose
God's son across the belly
I prove you lost already
The king is back, where my crown at?
Ill Will, rest in peace!
Let's do it, niggas!  Fuck with your soul like ether
 Teach you – the king – you know you
 God's Son across the belly
 I prove you lost already Y'all niggas deal with emotions like bitches
What's sad is I love you, ‘cause you're my brother
You traded your soul for riches
My child, I've watched you grow up to be famous
And now I smile like a proud dad watchin' his only son that made it
You seem to be only concerned with dissin' women
Were you abused as a child?
Scared to smile? They called you ugly?
Well, life is harsh, hug me, don't reject me
Or make records to disrespect me, blatant or indirectly
In '88 you was gettin' chased through your building
Callin' my crib and I ain't even give you my numbers
All I did was give you a style for you to run with
Smilin' in my face, glad to break bread with the God
Wearin' Jaz' chains, no TEC's, no cash, no cars
No jail bars, Jigga, no pies, no case
Just Hawaiian shirts, hangin' with little Chase
You a fan, a phony, a fake, a pussy, a Stan
I still whip yo' ass, you 36 in a karate class?
You Tae-Bo ho, tryna work it out, you tryna get brolic?
Ask me if I'm tryna kick knowledge?
Nah, I'm tryna kick the shit you need to learn though
That ether, that shit that make your soul burn slow
Is he Dame Diddy, Dame Daddy or Dame Dummy?
Oh, I get it, you Biggie and he's Puffy
Rocafella died of AIDS, that was the end of his chapter
And that's the guy y'all chose to name your company after?
Put it together: I rock hoes, y'all rock fellas
And now y'all try to take my spot, fellas
Feel these hot rocks, fellas, put you in a dry spot, fellas
In a pine box with nine shots from my Glock, fellas
Foxy got you hot ‘cause you kept your face in her puss
What you think, you gettin' girls now ‘cause of your looks?
Ne-gro, please! You no-mustache-havin'
With whiskers like a rat, compared to Beans you whack
And your man stabbed Un and made you take the blame
You ass, went from Jaz to hangin' with Kane
To Irv, to B.I.G. – and Eminem murdered you on your own shit
You a dick-ridin' faggot, you love the attention
Queens niggas run you niggas, ask Russell Simmons! Ha!
R-O-C get gunned up and clapped quick
J.J. Evans get gunned up and clapped quick
Your whole damn record label, gunned up and clapped quick
Shawn Carter to Jay-Z – damn, you on Jaz dick!
So little shorty's gettin' gunned up and clapped quick
How much of Biggie's rhymes is gonna come out your fat lips?
Wanted to be on every last one of my classics
You pop shit, apologize, nigga, just ask Kiss!
Yeah, Kendrick Lamar, tone what up,check it out
As the day go I let the beat rock
Then put my thoughts inside the cradle, hip hops
God Father plant the seed, you should be my son
And if you niggas hot, I guess I am the sun
I'm a degree away from global warming, this a warning
Shot like I knew Big but I'm enormous
I hear an Instrumental then I turn to Norman
So go tell ‘em I killed it you fucking informant
I’m always performing
Like it’s my last morning
Before I sit with the Lord and see my mother mourning
I’m in the air with it like a new pair of Jordans
Ground level never been important when I walk the earth
Walk to church bishop said he lost his Bible this time
Told me that he need a verse, I blessed him with a couple of lines
Bear hugged a few bears, wrestle with a couple of lions
That’s the imagery I delivery when I fuck a rhyme…
Fuck off, Kendrick Lamar Jay Rock motherfuckers you know what comes after that
My town I rep it till im off this map
Watts City, Eastside baby
Chillin in the bricks with bricks looking for fifty
It’s still in my blood, nigga it’s all natural
Welcome to L.A gangbang Capital, Still rocking my colours I wasn't sworn in it
I ain't a millennium baby,look I was born in it
Bless the beat when I speak everytime, cocaine bars that tweakin off every line
I’m in deep space now when I write, no pen no pad in my mind when I write
Flow bolder than a cold on a polar bear, shhh im the one that this rap niggas fear
You can’t do me, this game’s like an ocean catch a nigga floating on the top like a boat…Rock! Lil Watts lil Compton in the dash of the East
Kendrick Lamar, Rock, and Tone put you back in your seat
A natural beat
Got me like a savage and beast
The rap game start to look like an immaculate feast
I'm back in this piece
So listen when the package complete
Join the cause or hit the hills when disaster released
The passion in me
Got me spittin' accurately
So the realest MC is what I happen to be
You can vibe wit it or move back
These new jacks gettin blue black
With boom bap I proved that
Know my Golden State affiliates can prove that
On my menace shit Long Beach Venice shit
Primitive the way I crafted this all the penmanship
It's intricate now go and start the sirens
My microphone's on the flow is sparking violence
We the best duo out since Bo and Marcus Allen
Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me
I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb
In the shape of an L on her forehead
Well the years start coming and they don’t stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
So much to do, so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
You’ll never know if you don't go
You'll never shine if you don't glow
Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold
It's a cool place and they say it gets colder
You're bundled up now, wait till you get older
But the meteor men beg to differ
Judging by the hole in the satellite picture
The ice we skate is getting pretty thin
The water’s getting warm so you might as well swim
My world’s on fire, how about yours?
That's the way I like it and I never get bored
Hey now, you’re an all-star, get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
All that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold
Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show, on get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars
Somebody once asked could I spare some change for gas?
I need to get myself away from this place
I said yep what a concept
I could use a little fuel myself
And we could all use a little change
Well, the years start coming and they don’t stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
So much to do, so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
You'll never know if you don't go 
You'll never shine if you don't glow
Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold
Yeah, yeah, oh, you gotta love it
Oh, you got—oh, you gotta love it
I heard what circulated, let's get to the bottom of it
I told 1da send me something and I got it covered
Somehow I always rise above it
Why you think I got my head in the clouds
On my last album cover?
The game is all mine and I'm mighty possessive
Lil Wayne could not have found him a better successor
Every shot you see them take at me, they all contested
Allen Iverson shoe deal, these niggas all in question
Last night I went to sleep wanting more
Tried to decide what direction I should go towards
Some nights I wish I could go back in life
Not to change shit, just to feel a couple things twice
28 at midnight, wonder what's next for me
Longevity, wonder how long they'll check for me
Prolly forever if I stay in my zone
I speak on this generation, but can't change it alone
I heard a little little homie talking reckless in Vibe
That's quite a platform you chose
You should've kept it inside—oh, you tried
It's so childish calling my name on the world stage
You need to act your age and not your girl's age
It gets worse by the annual, my career's like a How-To manual
So I guess it's understandable, man
Oh, you gotta love it, you gotta love it, yeah
I know rappers that call Paparazzi to come and get 'em
To show they outfits off, guess they need the attention
I remember when it used to be music that did it
But then again times have changed, man, who are we kiddin'?
I'm managed by my friends that I grew up with
I'd rather give that 15% to people I fuck with
If me and Future hadn't made it with this rappin'
We prolly be out in Silicon tryna get our billions on
But here we are, yeah
Lately, I feel the haters eatin' away at my confidence
They scream out my failures
And whisper my accomplishments
Bitches alter my messages like we had words
And stories 'bout my life hit the net like a bad serve
Bitter women I'm overtextin' are PMSing
Crazy this year—fuckin' with my image
I've been tryna reach the youth so I can save 'em this year
Fuck it, I guess I gotta wait til next year
And I heard someone say something that stuck with me a lot
'Bout how we need protection from those protectin' the block
Nobody lookin' out for nobody
Maybe we should try and help somebody or be somebody
Instead of bein' somebody that makes the news
So everybody can tweet about it
And then they start to R.I.P. about it
And four weeks later nobody even speaks about it
Damn, I just had to say my piece about it
Oh, you gotta love it—but they scared of the truth
So back to me showin' out in public, that's a hotter subject
I've been whippin' Mercedes and nigga try to budget
I gotta make it back to Memphis to check on my cousins
Shout out to Ashley, Tasha, Bianca
Julia, Ericka, Southern America
Part of my heritage, pardon my arrogance
Part in my hair again, that's that comeback flow
Comeback flow, once I start it's apparent
I'm with girl whose ass is so big that's partly embarrassin'
But fuck all the blushin' and fuck your discussions
And fuck all the judgement
Your content so aggressive lately, what's irkin' you?
Shit is gettin' so personal in your verses too
I wanna prove that I'm number one over all these niggas
Bein' number two is just being the first to lose
My city dictated music, nobody seein' us
Winter here already, but somehow I'm heatin' up
Been observin' the game and felt like I've seen enough
Let's drop a tape on these niggas then we'll see what's up
Yeah, boy, you rappin' like you seen it all
You rappin' like the throne should be the three of y'all
Best I Ever Had seems like a decade ago
Decadent flow and I still got a decade to go
Oh please, take it ease, where's the love and the peace
Why you rappin' like you come from the streets?
I got a backyard where money seems to come from the trees
And I'm never ever scared to get some blood on my leaves
Phantom slidin' like the shit just hit a puddle of grease
I cook the beef well done on the double with cheese
Special order for anybody that's comin' for me
Shit you probably flinch if somebody sneeze
You see they got me back talkin' like it's just 40, Oli, and me
Cuttin' all loose ends, I be the barber for free
I'm almost at four minutes going off on the beat
Feel like I'm in the Malibu that had the cloth on the seats
Man, oh, you gotta love it
And on top of that it's getting harder to eat
Rappers downgrading houses, putting cars on the lease
To think labels said they had a problem marketing me
And now it's everybody else that's getting hard to believe
But man, oh, you gotta love it
And head to toe I'm Prada covered
I know your girl well, just not in public
Blame the city, I'm a product of it
Young nigga from the city—you gotta love it
You don't need me to ever write
I read your last message at least 1000 times
At least 1000, at least 1000 times
Alright, alright, alright
Why did you ever listen to
People trying to hate on you
At least you know that's nothing new
Stop everything you're doing now
'Cause baby, you're awesome
So awesome
You look too good to be at work
You feel too good to ever hurt
I hope you ready for tonight
I'm gon cook, you'll be dessert
You can't be still
You gotta move, you gotta dance
I gotta live, I gotta love
I got a hope, I got a chance
Cause baby, you're awesome
You don't need to listen to your manager
You're way too hot for them to handle you
Baby, not for nothing
I know you're looking for something
And I've got it
Why you fallin' on me
Cause I'd rather do nothing with you
Than something with somebody new
Yeah, I'd rather do nothing with you
Than something with somebody new
Stop everything you're doing now
Cause baby you're awesome
Don't let nobody bring you down
You're so awesome
You're so out the park
You're so after dark
You're so sleepless nights, oh you feel so right
Oh, you nnannanaa
I know you must be tired
From running through my mind
Can I come inside?
Cause baby you're awesome
Also, I'm also awesome, also
I'm also awesome
Y'all know
And I'd rather do nothing with you
Than something with somebody new
Yeah, I'd rather do nothing with you
Than something with somebody new
Stop everything you're doing now
Cause baby you're awesome
Don't let nobody bring you down
You're so awesome
You're so out the park, you're so after time
You're so breaking ?, oh it feels so rightI didn't step on the flag on purpose! It's a scene in a video where the flag drops behind me and after it drop it's just there as I perform It was never my intention to desecrate the flag of the United States of America. I was shooting a video for a song off my album entitled God Bless Amerika. The clip that surfaced on the Internet was a camera trick clip that revealed that behind the American Flag was the Hoods of America. In the final edit of the video you will see the flag fall to reveal what is behind it but will never see it on the ground. In most people eyes including my own who were raised in that environment, the Hood is the only America they know and the only America I knew growing up. I was fortunate from my God given talents to escape the Hood and see the other beautiful places this country has to offer but most people who are born in that environment don't get that chance. That's their view of their America. That was Dwayne M Carter from Hollygrove New Orleans view of America. That's who I'm speaking for in this song.
Woooo!!
Music up please
One, two, three... Born and raised in the USA
By way of New Orleans where the killers stay
Okay... uh, uh, alright, yeah

Tell them if they're lookin for me

Dope boy with a guitar... Born and raised in the USA

Yeah, come on!

If the screen from a tweaker's pipe turns black, that means it's bammer
If it's too many seeds in your weed, then chop 'em down
If your blood gets bogus, then run his ass out of town
I'm on the Carquinez Bridge, Terminal 3, quarter after seven
Pockets full of hundreds, can't seem to find no ones, engine revvin'
Smebbin', talkin' hella shit to the cashier
Pi-pi's get right behind me askin' me how much have I had to drink
And I said, A beer
Blitzed, out of my wits, drivin' drunk
Let's see I done hit one, two, three, ain't no tellin' how many skunk
In and out of the holding cell, blood alcohol like a warrior
And I refuse to answer any questions without the advisory of my lawyer I been in it, all around it, co-founded
Did it when I done it, I musta been blunted
Ninety-six hundred for the two P's
I let the homie K-One run through these
Base is on the roam, I left the hubs alone
I wonder if they're chippin' the Nextel phones
A bad motherfucker for the butter and grits
And you niggas need to know this shit You got Moesha, E?

And enough, to have your head kinda tough
Bluffin' don't exist, we pull the hoe cards
Tail between the legs when you walk in the yard
So if you hard, and wanna stay that way
You better watch where the fuck you play Check it out
It's bring your own bottle
'Cause I be likin' to get to perkin' somethin' awful
And come through that motherfucker slurrin'
Talkin' crazy to bitches, weeble-wobblin'
Burpin', gurpin', stomach growlin' off the hinges
Lurkin', twurkin', my stay highs with red lenses
I'm tryin' to get that fast quarter, fuck a slow nickel
Run a smooth ass operation without gettin' caught in the pickle
Take my cool ass on a vacation that maybe someday stop
Buy me an empty commercial lot
And turn it into a car wax wash and detail shop You got Moesha, E?

 If they call you a nigga
Ain't nothin' to it, tell 'em Nas made you do it
 If they call you a nigga
Ain't nothin' to it, tell 'em Nas made you do it
 If they call you a nigga
Ain't nothin' to it, tell 'em Nas made you do it
 If they call you a nigga
Ain't nothin' to it, tell 'em Nas made you do it Felonious, Thelonious Monk melodic
Monster Cody OG, hard as the Ramparts police
Warring like the Answars and Sunni
I never pull my pants up, sagging my Gucci, and what?
I give a fuck who you bidded with, or where you cop coke
The bitch you with or the reason you not broke 
I don't count your money, don't want none of your smoke
I don't feel your pain, I ain't none of your folk 
It's easy to put a gun in your throat
But I ain't on that, trying to sip Coladas where it's warm at
Cognac, crushed ice, y'all know how it is
Elijah said a women half your age plus seven years
Is a plush way to live, this is for the blunted
For the niggas who keep it one hundred
Who hunted by DAs and judges 
This is for the drunkards, stuck in the ghetto, for winos
And old ladies with high sugar levels
Who am I? I'm here to murder the devil
I survive through the struggle and perils, I'm thorough 
Who am I? I'm here to murder the devil
I survive through the struggle and perils, I'm thorough  If they call you a nigga
Ain't nothin' to it, tell 'em Nas made you do it
 If they call you a nigga
Ain't nothin' to it, tell 'em Nas made you do it
 If they call you a nigga
Ain't nothin' to it, tell 'em Nas made you do it
 If they call you a nigga
Ain't nothin' to it, tell 'em Nas made you do it Why do I call myself a nigga, you ask me?
Because police always wanna harass me! This is once again proof that no routine police stop is actually routine. We saw that last week, of course, in Brooklyn, with the tragedy over there, and then again last night, another police shooting.
Here's what they think about you!
I hate motherfuckers like you. You niggas ain't shit! Think you tough, huh? I could blow your head off with the Smith and Wesson and you couldn't do shit! How you feel now? If you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one I've got the Rap Patrol on the gat patrol
Foes that wanna make sure my casket's closed
Rap critics that say he's Money, Cash, Hoes
I'm from the hood, stupid! What type of facts are those?
If you grew up with holes in your zapatos
You'd celebrate the minute you was havin' dough
I'm like, Fuck critics, you can kiss my whole asshole!
If you don't like my lyrics, you can press fast forward.
Got beef with radio if I don't play they show
They don't play my hits, well, I don't give a shit, so
Rap mags try and use my black ass
So advertisers can give 'em more cash for ads
Fuckers, I don't know what you take me as
Or understand the intelligence that Jay Z has
I'm from rags to riches, niggas, I ain't dumb
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one – hit me! 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
If you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one – hit me! The year is '94, in my trunk is raw
In my rearview mirror is the motherfuckin' law
Got two choices, y'all: pull over the car or
Bounce on the devil, put the pedal to the floor
And I ain't tryin' to see no highway chase with Jake
Plus I got a few dollars, I can fight the case
So I pull over to the side of the road
I heard, Son, do you know why I'm stopping you for?
‘Cause I'm young and I'm black and my hat's real low?
Do I look like a mind reader, sir? I don't know
Am I under arrest or should I guess some more?
Well, you was doing 55 in a 54
License and registration and step out of the car
Are you carrying a weapon on you? I know a lot of you are.
I ain't steppin' out of shit, all my paper's legit
Well, do you mind if I look around the car a little bit?
Well, my glove compartment is locked, so is the trunk in the back
And I know my rights, so you gon' need a warrant for that
Aren't you sharp as a tack?
You some type of lawyer or something?
Somebody important or something?
Well, I ain't passed the bar, but I know a little bit
Enough that you won't illegally search my shit
Well, we'll see how smart you are when the K9 come!
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one – hit me! 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
If you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one – hit me!
99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
If you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one Now once upon a time not too long ago
A nigga like myself had to strong-arm a ho
This is not a ho in the sense of havin' a pussy
But a pussy havin' no goddamn sense, try and push me
I try to ignore him, talk to the Lord
Pray for him, but some fools just love to perform
You know the type, loud as a motorbike
But wouldn't bust a grape in a fruit fight
And only thing that's gon' happen is I'ma get to clappin'
And he and his boys gonna be yappin' to the Captain
And there I go, trapped in the Kit-Kat again
Back through the system with the riff-raff again
Fiends on the floor, scratchin' again
Paparazzis with they cameras, snappin' em
D.A. try to give a nigga shaft again
Half a mil' for bail ‘cause I'm African
All because this fool was harassin' them
Tryin' to play the boy like he's saccharine
But ain't nothin' sweet 'bout how I hold my gun
I got 99 problems, bein' a bitch ain't one – hit me! 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
If you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one – hit me! You crazy for this one, Rick
It's your boy
Back in the days on the boulevard of Linden
We used to kick routines and the presence was fitting I used to come through with the tools and Glocks
Party don't rock like it used to rock
Back door, nigga, I refuse to knock
I beat a nigga up out his shoes and socks
I used to come through with the tools and Glocks
Party don't rock like it used to rock
Back door, nigga, I refuse to knock
I beat a nigga up out his shoes and socks Standin' amazing, hit you in the brain
Get with Snoop Dogg, he can put you in the game
Put you on the stage, maybe even front page
Get a little fortune, have a little fame
Kill 'em with class, toast to the boogie while you fill up your glass
So quick, so fast
No razzmatazz, I'm just an eastside nigga
With my gangster ass, twenties
I used to pinch pennies
Only Gs, I don't fuck with no weenies
My clique is sick, it expandin'
To outlaws, riders and bandits
What you gon' do
When we coming to a hood near you?
You know I used to come through with the tools and Glocks
Party don't rock like it used to rock
Back door, nigga, I refuse to knock
I beat a nigga up out his shoes and socks
I used to come through with the tools and Glocks
Party don't rock like it used to rock
Back door, nigga, I refuse to knock
I beat a nigga up out his shoes and socks What's beef? 'Cause beef is in the kitchen
What you want dog? I'm on a million-dollar mission
How can you get it if you ain't been through shit?
I'm just a seed that was planted by Ruthless
My family tree is so G, we was cut from the cloth called LBC
Crybaby, used to C-Walk at the park
Pitbulls on a leash that would never bark
Real love, real dubs, real 'saniacs
Trip Locc, kinfolk, and Wayniac
Peace to the deceased that passed away
Duces 'n Trayz: The Old Fashioned Way
What you gon' do
When we pull up in a hood near you?
You know I used to come through with the tools and Glocks
Party don't rock like it used to rock
Back door, nigga, I refuse to knock
I beat a nigga up out his shoes and socks
I used to come through with the tools and Glocks
Party don't rock like it used to rock
Back door, nigga, I refuse to knock
I beat a nigga up out his shoes and socks Yeah, certified official gangsta shit
Unfiltered, like a pack of humps, nigga
Detrimental to all and any that disrespect or deviate from the G calls
It's either hog status or buster status
It ain't no in betweens
You can't wake up and put this on, nigga
Every breath you breathe gotta be committed to this shit
Clappin' niggas, tappin' switches, mackin' bitches
Mansion business and stackin riches
It's all a part of that lifestyle we created back in the days for the world to follow
Gs up, forever
The boss dogg an' Tha General, front line and on the east sideI'm more focused, see I'm nothing like you new 
 the front lines
Thinking they hot cause they homies said they was a few times
Which is too many times of lying to you, they telling a lie
The only time I lie in the booth is when I sleep in it
Record 24 hours, these niggas better get they bars up
I bench press this rap stuff, got it locked like handcuffs
I threw away the key, my cool is on, she love my AC
My jewels is on and I wish one of y'all try robbing me
I shoot and have you laying between the sheets with the Isley's
We push the coupe like a high speed and the helicopters come and realize theres nothing behind us, it's behind me
Your honor, I fuck over these beats with no condom
This ain't really a rap, it's a porno, rewind it back
It's back to defining a loss, correct, they don't obey
Y'all ain't nice nigga, y'all just okay
Y'all  more than a Lil Jon phrase
I'm Mike Jordan in his prime, a modern day Issac Hayes
Fingers on the shaft, new to the theme song of your career
Study my craft, you ignorant?, I can do it without a pen and a pad
It's inspiration, something y'all have never had
If my pockets is something  you're trying to grab, see I pull out a rocket and peel you back like scab, you old news
Old dudes get out my way let the young boy come through, don't mention my age, SHIT
I'm on a mission for pay and you astronaut niggas just crowding my space
You not in my atmosphere, you can act like you're here
But actually you ain't accurate fucking with this music biz
The industry like Fuck it, let the music be his
No theme park, I'm not trying to amuse you kids
Small shark, Jaws is here jump in the water
Do we really fuck with president Carter?
My reply is that I can't stay away from the bosses
Got the bidding war popping like an auction
Five or ten labels like What he hitting for?, seven zeros or more
Remember having Aftermath sitting on my door
Money in front of me I couldn't open the door I'm so far ahead of my time I got people 5 years from now pressing rewind
I'm hardly impressed with y'all, I hate rappers
Where the true artists at?, if it ain't a good picture you draw don't bring it to the architect
Often y'all arguing 'bout who got next
Claiming y'all running the game niggas is barely walking yet
Hopping all over beats without going through training camp
Try studying a few greats and then maybe you'll be where I'm at
Your songwriting ain't great, your mixtape is mediocre
You recycle the same quotes, you're not
Switching your flow, your flow in the same place
Don't just rap elaborate, expand, try to be more creative perhaps
My rap friends, I ain't saying that you whack, psych
Like an invoice I'm just stating the facts, right?
The metaphors I write
In fact you've been a factor you've feared your whole life, no TV show
Don't compare me with them, that's like Jaws vs. Nemo
A gorilla to a chimp, Jordan vs. Kukoc
A Tony Montana with blow in his nose to a Nino Rrrr Ting 
Watch your motherfuckin' tone, boy 
Get hurt, boy 
Aww, here go another muhfucker that don't understand
The concept of puttin' money first, boy 
I'm 'bout to hit you with the work, boy 
I'm 'bout to hit you with the work, boy 
I hate comin' through stuntin' on niggas that I know
Ahh, that's the worst, boy 
I'll admit it, I'll admit it 
You haven't been the man for like a minute
I told you that I'm in it for the long haul
You can really get the business 
I'll admit it, I'll admit it 
Rolling swishers, hittin' swishes
Got me feelin' like a ball hog
I don't pass 'em when I get it 
I'll admit it, I'll admit it 
You too worried 'bout the bitches 
I got one girl, and she my girl, and nobody else can hit it 
She'll admit it, she'll admit it 
She ain't fuckin' with you niggas
And just like every single other thing in my life
You can have her when I'm finished 
I hear the talk on road is I'm the shit, boy
Phone call back home, shit is hot up in the 6, boy 
Shit hot up in the 6 right now
Shit hot up in the 6, boy 
Shit is hot up in the 6 right now 
Come see us and get it fixed, boy 
Black Benz on the road, boy 
Already had a Rolls Royce 
Sold a couple Bentley last week
Them were my old toys 
I give a fuck about old, boy 
I give a fuck about his squad, boy 
I give a fuck about your mob, boy 
I'm the real 6 God, boy 
I'm about to say a true thing 
I'm about to say a true thing 
You was poppin' back when Usher wore a U-chain
Goddamn, you changed
I put it on 'erything, it's a Rrr Ting
It's a OVO come through murk things
I know you heard things
Bitch, I know you heard things
Yeah, I know you heard things, I know you
I'm not new to this
Coming from the motherfucking 6 side
I'm not new to this
Niggas wouldn't make it on this side
I'm not new to this, I'm not new, I'm not new
Yeah, I know you heard things
Nobody really likes us except for us
Yeah, all I ever needed was the squad so that's what's up
Yeah, my sound got the whole city in your way right now
Yeah, so I don't give a fuck about what anybody sayin' right now
Niggas can't be serious, man
Yo, yo Yo I'm the reason metal detectors go off the meter
'Cause I'll run through the airport with the heater
Gets the fag at his plane, and if I miss him
Put two in his brain at the baggage claim
Give him... heavy sluggage, tryna get his luggage
Send him to the crossroads, we way too thuggish
Shit, we at odds 'til we even up
'Til you leave on a stretcher or I leave in cuffs
Niggas wanna live, they done breathed enough
And I bet you next time they'll believe in us
It don't take much brains to know we bust things
My gat must bang, through your Mustang
Ma ma se, ma ma sa, ma ma ku sa
Niggas seen Kanye, red dotted them
Hurry up, stash the guns, the cops gon' come
And we gon' say we don't know who shot at 'em
Come on All I have is my real niggas 
Get this cash with my real niggas 
Give my last to my real niggas
Cock back, blast, for my real niggas
All I have is my real niggas
Get this cash with my real niggas 
Give my last to my real niggas 
Cock back, blast, for my real niggas Y'all niggas ready for war? I'm ready
Easy with the clip, girl, hold it steady
Man I'm 'bout to squeeze back, cock and bust hot lyrics
Cock back, pop, and touch y'all spirits
Send 'em to hell, make their residence more evil
This beat here make me wanna kill four people
Three niggas and one hoe, turn bitches to Jane Doe
Send 'em past rainbows, with the ankles
Hit 'em from all angles, bring the pain though
Blow out the candles, the show's been cancelled
Man, y'all niggas better believe somethin'
'Fore I squeeze somethin' and leave somethin'
It ain't nothin' with my real niggas All I have is my real niggas
Get this cash with my real niggas 
Give my last to my real niggas 
Cock back, blast, for my real niggas
All I have is my real niggas
Get this cash with my real niggas 
Give my last to my real niggas 
Cock back, blast, for my real niggas I feel like one lady, five babies and four fathers
Six months searchin' for jobs and no offers
No heat 'cept for the stove
Sleep with two layers of clothes, still wakin' up cold
I'm real, like AIDS
Like the pain you feel when your nigga get strained
That's why I got issues like I got pistols
I gotta make your mama cry but I got tissues
I confess, I'm a gangsta
But I drop my flag, still cock back and drop a fag
Leave him in a bag with a tag on his metatarsals
Awfully ill, man, awfully real
Thugged out, but I'm God's property still
And if I up the steel, I'ma probably kill
If not, you're paralyzed from the waist down
Alright dog, you're the king? I'm the ace now
Face down All I have is my real niggas 
Get this cash with my real niggas
Give my last to my real niggas 
Cock back, blast, for my real niggas 
All I have is my real niggas 
Get this cash with my real niggas
Give my last to my real niggas 
Cock back, blast, for my real niggas 
Get this cash with my real niggas
Give my last to my real niggas
Cock back, blast, for my real niggas
All I have is my real niggas
Get this cash with my real niggas
Give my last to my real niggas
Cock back, blast, for my real niggas
Baby lion goes

Ex-sinner, Grammy award winner
Ballin' repeatedly, highlights on Sportscenter
Please repeat after me - there's only one rule
I WILL NOT, LOSE!
Swallow your pride and then eat a dick
Make the rulers apologize, you ain't ruling shit
I'm Rick Rubin in '85 with the beard thick
Thick bitch type peruvian slanted eyes that squinch
I tell you that I'm one up
Sun down, or sun up
Son, I son niggas
I probably fucked your mama
With no condom
That's good pussy, pussy
Tell it to your honor
This trauma is Jeffery Dahmer
It took me too many moons to fuck up this new platoon
Get ambushed or kick pushed with push brooms
Man look, your man look like sweet water
Cornbread that break under pressure when he's caught up
They call me said I gotta crawl before I walk
And if I ran my mouth then my legs would get cut off
I'm just a young boss in the batcave
Back against the wall
I came back with them back pains Tell 'em put my name on a gym ball
Like I'm Derrick Rose
Ho, know my gym
And players not allowed
I'm spiking your game towel
And spiking your Gatorade with gasoline I'm foul
I'm in the crowd like Artest and them
I move the crowd like Artest and them
Punchlines mean I really go and punch civilians
Crunch time mean I take it to the hole
Not a basket, but rather this good pussy that I'm in
I assassin you niggas
I make your weight shape thin
Blank tapes in your deck
You can still break they necks
They hear it, you need clearance from the label just to spin
I need to clear it with the bank just to spend
Club appearance go for twenty-five racks
When you getting it like that, shit, it gotta be a sin
So Lord forgive me yes I'm a sinner
But these hoes is with me cause I'm a winner
Back when we ate canned food for dinner
I coached fools to protools to make my agenda
I'm tofu, Im nasty like tofu
I wish a motherfucker would
Get your whole career injured
Nigga, that's assault with a deadly weapon
I killed your favorite rapper
Favorite rapper last record
I fucked your favorite actress on the matress
What a blessing
Make that pussy ante up
She call my dick antidepressant
I'm really not impressed with
None of you niggas stressing
That some of you niggas blessed with
The gift to carry the presence
Picking popping
I'm popping big shit with label investments
Fifteen minutes go for fifty seconds
Last night, I spent twelve hours inside a session
Came up with shit, writer's block
Niggas up in this dressing like
Who the fuck cares? Who the fuck cares?
Even when you Slumdog, you'll still be a millionaire
Nigga playing Santa Claus will make sure you hold deer
Have him first put that bitch in a hearse while Rock steer
Church to you pussies
You push me, get pap smeered
Burst out your cookie
I read it, my fortune is here Look, this be that shit that make real niggas grab they dicks
And bitches rubbing on they tits
Until they fingers monkey wrenched
Monkey see what monkey do
You monkeys never make no sense
Jump up a tree, shit on you
Shitting bricks that can build a castle
No hastle when breaking your picket fence
Know pterodactyls that still exist
And clap you if you resist
Cooperate, go home and seen they daughters copulate
And you at risk
You wear a bracelet, we want your wrist
You can taste it from planet Pluto
Doggone it, you panic just like a poodle
Rip out your culo, then kudos
Two Door regal, El Caminos, and two more
Cause I 
Wipe it off on my shoe, ho
Before you  your Menthol
Meant to get smoked then sent off
To Jamaica
No trace of a Laker with Toni Kukoc
Means ain't no hood
Hopping California JACO
Watching Snoop's latest prince get down

Yeah Prayer for our sins, I...
Prayer for our souls, the...
Tears that we're cryin'
Let 'em all be forgiven
Let it all be forgiven 
Just let it all be forgiven When your dreams turn to nightmares
Transactions turn to Nike Airs
Went to Greenbriar Mall and bought five pairs
I stayed in the Creek, junkies used to preach
In the dope game, tryna reach my peak and go undefeated
I pleaded with the judge, this my first offense
High school b-ball, I'm tryna get a scholarship
No ACC, SEC, ClayCo APD
On a bumpy road like an ATV, EBT
Used to give me peace
I smile on the outside, inside discreet
As far as the past, wish I could press delete
Let my dogs off the leash
Rather buy it than lease or get murdered in the streets, fine line Who can learn
Pray for the children 
I pray for our healing 
I know you feel it 
Just let it all be forgiven 
Just let it all be forgiven 
Your sins, let 'em all be forgiven 
Dead lies, that is how we livin' 
Just let it all be forgiven Got a phone call from Lil' Fate
Somebody shot his son, he didn't make it
My head achin', hands started shakin'
Foul beyond flagrant
He said, Bro, what I'm supposed to do?
I paused, remorseful
We been partners since public school
Kids ain't supposed to die before us
As a parent, it's apparent, ain't no parents
Seeing stops once we leave the carriage
Cold of the streets react with the heat to create balance
One of the biggest revenge is prayer
Me, Shondrae, and 'Cris was there
Guess Flesh won't spend Christmas there
But in spirit, know you hearin' it loud and clear
Whole family miss you as we stare off in the atmosphere
No fear Prayer for our sins, I...
Prayer for our souls, the...
Tears that you're cryin'
Just let 'em all be forgiven 
Let 'em all be forgiven 
Just let 'em all be forgiven 
Your sins let 'em all be forgiven  Hey, I don't know need to hear this
Dead lies, that is how we livin'
But if you're doin' somethin' to make...
Just let 'em all be forgiven
If you're doin' somethin' to make your parents have to bury you
You may want to slow down
Everything got a consequence, whether good or bad
Rest in Peace Chalyne
Bigg, I love you, bruh
You know what I'm sayin'?
My other partner lost his son too, right before the 18th birthday
We out here bullshitin', for what?
Pray for my soul
You don't get another life
This ain't no practice life
Pray for my sins
These tears that I'm crying, let them all be forgiven
Let them all be forgiven
That's it, that's it In all his majesty and might, his brilliance and his beauty
His black and his blue
Boy, still slips from their lips when they address him
Still linger in the velvet of his dreams, the scene unseen
Black boy fightin' for manhood in a world that still sees through Jim Crow lens
Oh, them love him in his place
Separate, away, torn, disconnected, passive, submissive, and shufflin'
Oh, now just turn that shufflin' into dancin'
'Cause you know them love black boys dancin'
And singin' and ballin'
You know them love black boys' strength
But don't love black boys
Let me see your hands
*Gunshot*

Oh yeah

Happy as can be 
You keep blessing me 
Just believe 
Taste and see 
Oh-wee

He's blessing me again yeah 
When my spirit gets a little low, oh-ooh-oh
He lifts me up, he's blessing me again  I took a chance for real, so I can dance up in heaven
My granny used to always tell me you gon' be a reverend
But how could I see what she's saying?
When I was seven I didn't wanna go to hell so I kept steppin'
Reppin', for the lord, no weapon will be formed
Sunshine, on the grind, take me through the storm
Seems like he testing me again
But on the flip side, it's like he blessing me again Oh, you better come on now
Every time I turn around 
Blessing me again oh, oh
Every time I turn around 
Over, over and over again
Over and over and over again

Call the King of Diamonds and tell China it'd be worth the flight
I'll be at my table stackin' dollars to the perfect height
Work somethin', twerk somethin' basis
She just tryna make it so she's right here gettin' naked
I don't judge her, I don't judge her but I could never love her
Cause to her I'm just a rapper and soon she'll have met another
That's why me and Lil Jaz bout to spaz, can you keep up?
I'm just feelin' sorry for whoever got to sweep up

I-I think I may have to take it back to like, like 10 years ago, you know?
The Big Meech Era, you feel me?
Real, real motivation for a street nigga
Real, real motivation for a street nigga, ugh Pull up in all color Ferraris, bitches in tiaras
Gettin' head while I'm steering
Everybody else starving, everybody else staring
Shawty got the McLaren and I had the seven
Pulled up at the compound, clothes smellin' like gunpowder 
Salute all the real niggas and real bitches that got they own boss
I was snappin' before Fabo, my raps come with a halo
Went out with Jeezy, we spent pesos like J-bo
Took E’s to the Twenty Grande
He got a pistol on him and twenty grand
A couple things I ain't glorifying is the kids dying and the mommas dying 
Everybody need to calm down
Stand right by your homie's side
Gunshots in this motherfucker turn this bitch into a homie-side  Over a million sold they say I'm crossin' over
Oh yeah, the club packed, I should’ve brought a rubber
My whole body inked, my family hardly know me
You know I put that work in just to get a Rollie 
Big Meech era, Japanese Dinner
Trap in these denim 
Ain't stuntin' these women 
Wood grain steering wheel, I might get a splinter
If this a flexing contest I think we found a winner Put this shit down, that shit still burnin', I can smell that moon rock
I got to tell you how that shit started


Had that pack ordered, we was backed up 
That's that good shit, that’s that hood shit 
You a cute bitch, and your crew thick 
Got a chopper on me the size of pool stick 
With a Blue DaVinci, dog food bricks 
Snowman on repeat, rest in peace, Nando
I see Jigg in here I see Quazy too
When brawl wit'you we send them bottles through
We send the marters through, I'm on the Carter 2
Like Tyrese was on the Marta, too
They start calling too, startin' falling through
Got them chickens boy, like a barbecue  
Talk to lame niggas something we hardly do
I sip the PJ bottle I rock the AP on them. 
I think my rollie harder this an AG party Over a million sold they say I'm crossin' over
Oh yeah, the club packed, I should’ve brought a rubber
My whole body inked, family hardly know me
You know I put that work in just to get a Rollie
Big Meech era, Japanese Dinner
Trap in these denim
Trap in these denim
Ain't stuntin' these women
Wood grain steering wheel, I might get a splinter
If this a flexing contest I think we found a winner I think we found a winner
Uh-oh, flexing contest I think we found a winner
Pull up in some shorts, middle of December
Flex, ooh I got ice all over my windshield
I can tell it's gon' be a cold winter
I hit the defrost, I never turn the heat off
And still I'm so chilly willy snowflake
These silly billies really fail to act as if they know Drake
Always gossipin' callin' and textin'
Magneto niggas tryna bring down ex-men
Tellin' my ex-girl tryin' to explain
How I am no good, so go with the next man, but dog
You don't know me, you don't know us
We go by the name of A-T-F, and any previous affiliation
They know to hold they tongue and I spare 'em humiliation
I know you in and out, nigga I am not playin'
Just fall back, keep on Escape'in and Alize'in
And stop tryna act like you like me and my team
Not us, so you knock us, that's precisely what I mean
And dog, it's forever clear, my money evergreen
My presence required in places you have never been
It's all in a day's work, that's what I am on
NBC, MTV, Viacom
And whose Continental GT is outside
Showin' them how monumental he be?
One wheel on the curb, ticket on the dash
It's like every fuckin' summer I just switch it on they ass
And maaan I'm a commodity, none of them as hot as me
The industry standard, so I am what they gotta be
Cause Drake's syllables is like Jake Gyllenhaal
Can't help it, I been brainwashed to kill 'em all
I think I should pass my own amendment
You frontin' with glass all in your pendant
You ain't livin', rapper, you never have been
You a has-been, a gas station attendant
Your man is a turkey, you wit' a liar
I'm clearin' the air, I'm a humidifier
I'm spittin' fire, and gettin' flyer
And what you plannin' for this summer, I did it prior
I've shattered shows in tattered clothes
Met status quos, this is the South
And I am, present when it matters most
The startin's hot but pay attention to my latter flows
Givin' brain ain't bad girl, don't be that opposed
I flatter hoes
And drink Dom, they always ask me, Is that a rose?
You mean Rosé? Why yes it is
I stopped trying years ago, this is effortless
I'm in your house got the key to your home
I am Jeopardy asked Wikipedia known
I am A.A. driven and Expedia flown
So stop jackin' my style, you're in need of ya own, manI use to tote a .38; I tote that AK-47
In my crack days; in my rap days I use to tote a .38 up in my crack days 
I tote that AK-47 in my rap days 
I use to tote a .38
I tote that AK-47 in my rap days
I use to tote a .38 up in my crack days
I tote that Ak-47 I'm too fly, can't stay up in my bat cave
Hello, say goodbye when the gat wave
Hold on to your surf board when the gat wave
Homie, you can be deleted like backspace
I'm comin' through like a fax page
I'm just a gorilla in a unlatched cage, I peel off like black tape
Weed & Syrup, good combination like a cracked safe
Uhmm, real nigga in the buildin', where the Cris at?
I got them twins with me, you know, click-clack
I got them M's with me, you know, big stacks
I stay on the right side when that bridge crack
Cash Money, everything understood, everybody hop on a Lil Wayne that could
Haha, Hollygrove, that's my hood, Eagle Street is where I stood, boy! See When I Saw My First Murder When I Was Only 7
4 Years After That, I Did My First 2-11
A 2-11 That Turned To A 1-87
The Block Wad Dialing 9-11 For The 4-11
We Left The 7-11, Lookin' Like 9-11
They Skipped The Doctor And Ambulance And They Called The Reverend
See That Was Then Homie, And This Is Now Breadren
I'm This Close From Copin' The Porshe 9-11
The 9-11, That's The Reason For My AR
The M-14 Is For My Nigga JR
See I Don't Feel Too Many Rappers Cause' They Are
Softer Than Girls In Catholic School
Yaw Boyz Rap Like Ya'll Went To Actin' School
I Thank, My Beef, The Guns Show Em' Gratitude
Young Money, whether we're traveling or not, we pack a tool
Why N.W.A., them Niggas With Attitudes 
Uhh, Lord, Lord y'all
What I'm gon' do?
Uhh, *sigh*, Lord, Lord y'all
Haha, shit is all true Mmm... Fried chicken, fly vixen
Give me heart disease but need you in my kitchen
You a bird but you ain't a ki'
Got wings but you can't fly away from me
Driving in your bucket seats
All the way from Kentucky to fuck with me
Look what you done to me, was number one to me
After you shower, you and your gold medal flour
Then you rub your hot oil for about a half an hour
You in your hot tub I'm looking at you salivating
Dry you off I got your paper towel waiting
Lay you down cause you're red hot
Louisiana style you make my head rot
Then I flock to the bed then, plop!
When we done I need rest
Don't know what part of you I love best
Your legs or your breast
Mrs. Fried Chicken, you gon' be a nigga death
Created by southern black women to serve massa' guest
You gon' be a nigga death
Mrs. Fried Chicken you was my addiction
Dripping with high cholest-
Like Greeks with his falafel, Italian with his to-mato pasta
What roti is to a rasta
Trapping me; you and your friend mac' and cheese
Candy yams, collard greens but you knocking me to my knees
It's killing me when I'm inside
Nothing I need more than a fish fry Shit, it taste good I can't lie
It's like you're walking out the tanning salon
When I pull you out the oven from baking I got you on my mind
Rubbing that sun tan lotion all up over your body
So amazing how you sparkle when I glaze you swine
Hey, my pretty HamHock
It's so feminine the way you submitted and how you gave me power
To massaging me to shower you with lemon water
Marinate you with seasoning and dipping you in chowder
Baby it's like you at the spa the way you gently lay in the pan
While enjoying your butter milk treatment
I sit and watch the grease sizzle bubbling on your skin
Despite the funny fragrance still I lick my finger frequent
In any event, I'm reflecting on all the signs
That I got saying that I shouldn't fuck with you
But the way you that you would taste made you hard to resist
When I put my mouth on you but that's another issue
Butterflies up in my stomach, when I laid eyes on you
Or was it infection manifesting
Confused over the feeling, impatiently eating you
Trichina worm chewing on the wall of my intestine
I'm a eat you until there's nothing left
Until my very last breath, you gon' be a nigga death
Despite I prepare it the best and specialize in cooking swine as a chef
You gon' be a nigga death
Who cares if the swine is mixed with rat, cat and dog combined
Yes, I'ma eat the shit to death Ain't that some shit
I'ma eat some shit until what I'm eating kills me
And I choose to do that, why?
'Cause that's just what niggas do, hahahahahaYou can't love, but I bet ya
Yo can't hine yeah Here we Gooo
The 1st time around
I left the cars at the house
And I put the diamonds down
Them things come and they go it's bout the rhyme-in Now
I'm seeing it clearer, the season is nearer
And still I must change, I'm like a broken bill
Conservative for the most but I'm out spoken still
They not sure it'll work but their all hoping
He'll emerge the victim, my words are pictures
And yes the colors so loud that u heard my scripture
With four walls
Give me the right brush and I draw all
I promise I been thinkin' before ya'll
I barely get tired, I'm rarely inspired
And you accomplish in a week is What I'm daily required
I'm meetin' quotas while you rappers having sleep overs
Spending nights in studio try to be Hova
Be in the throne instead of being ya own
But look Young Check your freestyle
I am fast approachin' on the weekend
It's me, Niko, Bryans here, D10
Freestyle shit bout to segway to the verse here we go It's like I'm makin' moves in my city though
My ex girls wanna be up in the video
They ex girls are steady tryin' to get with me though
Important and vital
I'm caught in a cycle
And this is all I know
And yes I know it well
I try to explain
And my effort comes to no avail
I'm from the place where they release records and no one sells
And still they claim king
Nigga it's the same thing
All day long
But that's the screw face
Rappers will friend you at first but really they two faced
Hoping you trip and slip over your own shoe lace
That's why I tuck em in not givin' a fuck again
D.R.A you add the K.E a hundred grand and you labels can not
Play me
I'll never go broke
Fuck em I'm flashin' the pan
I am a passionate man
Planted with cash in my hand uhh Look... I got few days left
And I'm a make use of every single one
Untill every singles done and till every record is sold
And till every string is strung
They tell me to take a breather and Drake everything will come
Dog... it's always been the same
It's all love
Like no score in a tennis game
For the son of Dennis James
Owner of the city downtown on a Friday
Streets behind me like I took a picture in a driveway
I roll down strips and hosed down whips that when turtles wax up
They will close down richmond
With no down shiftin'
Haters will say I'm adequate
I think I got the type of flow to make a addict quit
19 years I been pimpin' since then repurchased Trap Muzik 4 time since then
Seamless transition I'm the new fresh prince gettin' pennies for my thoughts
So I put my 2 cents in
Top of the mornin' I am dropin' a coin in plus
I'm changin' the game you see me swapin' a joint in
They put fire out bring the buyers out and try to box us all together
For they buy us out
They profit from the event
We handin' fliers out
We profit from the attempt to hand desires out
But rich is how we're all endin' up
So if you selling charter Jetts call Brenden up
Holla! That's that crack music nigga
That real black music nigga

That's that crack music nigga
That real black music nigga
 How we stop the Black Panthers?
Ronald Reagan cooked up an answer
You hear that? What Gil Scott was hearin'
When our heroes or heroines got hooked on heroin
Crack raised the murder rate in D.C. and Maryland
We invested in that, it's like we got Merrill lynched
And we been hangin' from the same tree ever since
Sometimes I feel the music is the only medicine
So we, cook it, cut it, measure it, bag it
Sell it, the fiends cop it, nowadays they can't tell if
That's that good shit, we ain't sure man
Put the CD on your tongue, yeah that's pure man That's that crack music nigga
That real black music nigga

That's that crack music nigga
That real black music nigga
 From the place where the father's gone
The mothers is hardly home
And the Madigan's lock us up in the Audy Home
How the Mexicans say, we just tryin' to party holmes
They wanna pack us all in a box like styrofoam
Who gave Saddam anthrax?
George Bush got the answers
Back in the hood it's a different type of chemical
Arm & Hammer baking soda raised they own quota
Right when our soldiers, ran for the stove 'cause
'Cause, dreams of being Hova
Went from bein' a broke man to bein' a dopeman
To bein' the President, look there's hope man
This that inspiration for the Moes and the Folks man
Shorty come and see his momma straight overdosin'
And this is the soundtrack
This the type of music that you make when you 'round that That's that crack music nigga
That real black music nigga

That's that crack music nigga
That real black music nigga
 God, how could you let this happen  That's that crack music, crack music
That real black music, black music

That real black music nigga



That's that crack music, crack music
That real black music, black music
 Our Father, give us this day, our daily bread
Before the feds give us these days and take our daily bread
See I done did all this ol' bullshit
And to atone, I throw a lil' somethin' somethin' on the pulpit
We took that shit, measured it and then cooked that shit
And what we gave back was crack music
And now we ooze it through they nooks and crannies
So our mommas ain't got to be they cooks and nannies
And we gon' repo everything they ever took from granny
Now the former slaves trade hooks for Grammys
This dark diction has become America's addiction
Those who ain't even black use it
We gon' keep baggin' up this here crack music

I promise I swear the po-po threw my homie in the slammer
Did him bad, wish I had my candid camera, made me mad
Penelopes swarmin' like bees, surveillance binoculars hidden in trees
Reliable sources copping pleas, oh p-uh-please
One for the life, and two for death
Three damn strikes no chances left
Let me tell ya lil 'bout me, E-40 and the C-L-I-C
We used to have to use sheets for curtains, socks for washtowels
I was happy as hell when my cousin gave me his hand-me-downs
This ain't no happy Shirley Temple tale-listic crap
This here is serious, more realistic than Radio Shack
Observe as I strike a nerve, reach out and touch my kind
Open up your photo album, man, and I bet you find
Folks that passed away, potnas that been blasted away

'Cause if I ran home and didn't fight back my mom'd beat that tail
Just received word from my folks upstate
They said uh, they tryin' to, they tryin' to take away our weights
And uh, no more beef and pork, just Muslim books and fish
Walking laps around the yard with my Walkman bumpin' this
Now I'm bouts to get married, is it clever?
Thought it was 'til I got the Dear John letter
Been down for ten months and got a eight-year stay
And I just found out she had her baby yesterday
Ain't nobody been to see me yet, but I ain't gonna worry

Watchin' the pervin contestses between E-40 and Del
That's what we did up under the bridge, fools posted up
Choppin' game, conversatin', gettin' toast up
Leanin' against my Zeniths, convertible tops and who's the cleanest
Them Click boys smobbin' deep in cuts, actin' meanest
The good times, they gone, here in the can is my new home
Guess in order to do some right I had to do some wrong
Picked up a package yesterday and I was HAPPY
It was a box full of goodies from my PAPPY
Tripped me out, ain't seen or heard from Potna Duke in years
Sent me a picture and some fetti, dang near sheddin' tears, huh
See, first you born then you live then you die
One day soon I'll get another try, 1-Luv One love  One love

Well 
One love 
Hey 
One love 
Yeah yeah yeah Well seeing that, I think I, maybe for one of the first times in my life, I understand how it is to feel humbled. I want to say some thank yous really quick. Thank God for Stephen Hill, who is so sincerely good at exactly what he does and gives so much and doesn't care about what Ghost somebody's driving or how big somebody's house is and brings the most awesome collection of classic, current, and futuristic black music every day. So, make some noise for Stephen Hill to start this So, since this is pre-taped and the fact that Adam Blackstone used to be my music director, I'm pretty sure he's not gonna start the music on me. If I go Chicago for a second, you know it was interesting when I went and visited Minister Louis Farrakhan, and I just really wanted to expand so much more on the things that I had been talking about over the past couple years. And it was interesting or groundbreaking and really special for me to see his reaction and his expression about my relationship with a woman not of color, and for us to focus on the idea of love and not the idea of separation. You know, at the barbershop and everything, I used to hear people talking about, You know when an entertainer get on, of course you know he gon' go and get a white girl and buy her all this... and the white girl gon' go and get a rich black dude. But I want to say that my wife has dated broke black dudes. So it ain't got nothing to do with the money And it takes me back to a story that she told me where her father, Robert Kardashian, walked out, and on the side of his Bentley, they wrote Nigga lover because Robert Kardashian was the genius that put together the defense team that got O.J. off. She had never seen her father curse, get mad, he was the most laid back human being. And he went so crazy and tried to chase the people down, and she sat there crying and said, Dad why you going so crazy? He said to her, One day you may have a black child. A beautiful, beautiful, beautiful black child. And it's gonna be hard, you're gonna see how hard it is. So, true enough, we deal with racism because there are different races, or the micro of it is that we focus on the different races, as opposed to the macro, which is the human race. The bit of soundbytes that everyone loved from last year that got taken out of context or misunderstood did come from a place of saying part of the reason why I'm not allowed to be empowered is because of race, because of people's perception of celebrity, because all they want to present to young black men is the idea of making it to the league or making it to be a rapper, but not the idea of becoming an owner. And they would do anything they can to make it seem like a truthful idea is a stupid idea or a crazy idea Harriet Tubman said she could have freed so many more, and I'm sorry mom if that was incorrect English. Harriet Tubman could have freed more if they only knew they weren't free. So don't think that because we can afford this custom Balmain suit that we're free. And don't think that because we can buy a $300,000 car that we're free. And don't think that because it's 3% of a gated community that has colored people in it that we're free. It's the mentality, the slave mentality, where we all eventually become slaves to that car. Slaves to the perception. Slaves to the idea of being cool I thought it was so appropriate the way Wayne Brady kicked his whole shit off tonight. For us to express ourselves. Our power, our oil, since we don't own any oil. Our oil is our expression, is our influence. Don't never let them take that away. And when we have the chance to express it and influence, don't only do it for us, do it for the human raceBe next, Be NXT

The ghetto has been bastardized by those that capitalize
Wonder if it's a plan that the master devised
To bring his people to a land where the blacks are despised?

Middle fingers up and say Fuck the world
Throw your hands up, they can't fuck with you girl

There’s 3 balls and a strike. Here's the pitch. It's belted deep to center, Revere goes back, jumps at the wall, and it's gone! Isn't it amazing how you talk all this shit and we still lack communication

How every conversation starts with this time will be different
Oh, the idea is fun, oh, the idea is fun
Oh, the idea is so fun every time
At least we try for home run every time Swanging, eyes closed just swanging
Same city, same friends if you're looking for me
Same city, same friends if you're looking

Don't talk to me like I'm famous
And don't assume cause I don't respect assumptions bae
I'm just tryna connect with somethin' baby
Yeah, swanging She just wanna run around the city and make memories
That she can barely remember
And I'd allow her, talk about pussy power
She just wanna run over my feelings
Like she drinking and driving in an 18 wheeler
And I'd allow her, talk about pussy power
She used to say: You can be whoever you want, even yourself
Yeah, I show up knowin' exactly who I was and never leave as myself
But when it falls apart, I'm always still down
To pick a million tiny little pieces off the ground
Wish you would learn to love people and use things
And not the other way around Swanging, eyes closed just swanging
Same city, same friends if you're looking for me
Same city, same friends if you're looking
I'll be here just swanging
Don't talk to me like I'm famous
And don't assume cause I don't respect assumptions bae
I'm just tryna connect with somethin' baby
I'll be here, just swanging I remember when my schedule was as flexible as she is
She call and tell me be here before the sun up
I be dressed before we hung up
I take Eglinton to 401 east
And exit at Markham road in the east end

But it's a difference between black artists and wack artists If I gotta slap a pussy-ass nigga, I'ma make it look sexy
It's the one and only, the world's greatest, the Kid Capri
If I gotta go hard on a bitch, I'ma make it look sexy
I pull up, hop out, air out, made it look sexy
They won't take me out my element
Nah, take me out my element You cocked back
You thought you had it planned, you thought you had your man
He saw you coming, he ran when you tried to blast that man
You missed him by inches, he sprinted
Some of his boys on the corner was who your bullets entered
Two of 'em pull through but one didn't, son's finished
You took the life of him
The part about it that's crazy, you was aight with him
Tight with him, why was he in the way?
Why was he standing next to the enemy that specific day?
His style never hollas loud, stays reclusive
Good dude, got that look like he always about to do shit
Side of his mouth toothpick, one eyebrow raised
Got into it with dude who still tried to live out his old wild out days
They never had no probs
Somehow they rubbed each other wrong like a bad massage
These two different personalities had to collide
Niggas could not aim and innocent niggas died
You ask why, cause of a Accident murderer, act like you killed on purpose
Liars brag, you put work in
You ain't mean to murk him, your gun's a virgin
Streets are full of 'em, read the bulletin
Accident murderer
You just an accident murderer We grew up doing graffiti, now hollow heads getting heated
Seated in foreign cars, constantly getting weeded
Proceeded to count profits, I know they got on binoculars
But fuck em all, we balling 'til they come lock us up
20 to life; I'm clubbing, blowing 20 tonight
We the mob, Bob Marley Marlin' all through the night
Addicted to wealth, never cold turkey to war
Snatch a TEC off the shelf, live forever; that's Insh'Allah
Memoirs of a rich nigga
Sweat suits, gold chains, old drug dealers
New Benz, chrome rims are for show, killer
You niggas accidental, shoppers in back of the limo

How they gon' kill that beautiful sister?
Violent adolescents, homicidal with weapons
Not a lot of knowledge inside of they minds, that I'm guessing
Tell me who you impressing
Shooters I knew them when they was babies, I used to test them
Make em throw up they hands, choke 'em out playing wrestling
Watch em grow to a man, I see them now they repping
But they cold-blooded, homie, wondering where the respect went
Can't play with these little niggas, gangsta little niggas
Can't hang with these little niggas, they're killing, they're reckless
Wish I could build with him, but will he change really?
Some real killers, I think of Wayne Perry
Think of my nigga Drawz, but you aren't a name to me
You ain't mean to kill him, it wasn't necessary Accident murderer, act like you killed on purpose
Liars brag, you put work in
You ain't mean to murk him, your gun's a virgin
Streets are full of em, read the bulletin

Oh Lord, oh Lord we're not in Kansas anymore
We're not in Kansas anymore
I'm a man, I gotta take care of my family
Fighting these pressures in my life
I know my mind should be on shinin' and gettin' Grammy's
But these streets won't say goodbye  
I can't say goodbye 
Goodbye 
Goodbye 
I can't say goodbye 
Goodbye 
Goodbye 
I can't say goodbye 
Goodbye 
Goodbye 
I can't say goodbye 
Goodbye 
Goodbye  I guess it's true, you can't take the hood out the homeboy
Plus my hood just lost another homeboy
Another one got locked, and we don't know
If he comin' home boy
The industry tell me, just leave it alone boy
Let them do them, take care of your own boy
But I sit back, think about, before I was grown boy
Then had dreams of bein' a doe boy
Yeah I was runnin' from the po-po, bangin' for the turf
Late night huntin', puttin' in work
Hood day comin', airbrushed shirt
Payday at the spot, got my haircut first
Made mom sick when I wouldn't go to church
See I live in the 'burbs but I think 21st
I know since I've left that it's gotten much worse
But I'd still be there if I couldn't write a verse To the blocks that raised me
The enemies and the homies that made me
Tough enough to hang on the corners that would mold me
Critics wonder if I'm tryin' to be the old me
But if they think the old me ever left
Then they don't really know me
And gon' know we don't change, we just become O.G
You always addicted to the life, you just don't O.D
But shit, I owe the streets before they owe me
Took me in when my mama didn't want me
Too wild to be her child, and pops not around
Now all I got now is the homies
To teach me, how to be a man and what not
How to break ounces into grams and what not
The reason I'm so nice with my hands and what not
Shit, you think I forgot? Nah Thank God every day that the boy could spit
And all around the world they enjoyin' my shit
I know I got plenty more awards to get
I got a beautiful wife and some gorgeous kids
But it wouldn't be right if I ignored the shit
That made me who I am, the music and the man
Told me that I can before the world gave a damn
If it wasn't for my niggas sayin' stick to the plan
Probably be a gun instead of a pen in my hand
Probably be doin' a dub in the pen with my man
They say leave the streets but they don't really understand
All I had was the block when I didn't have fans
Rapped on the corners when I couldn't get spins
All I had was the homies when I didn't have kids
If it all came down, my career was to end
I'm sure my name would live, in these streets 
Hmm, uh-huh

Bitch
Man, this life shit gettin' crazy, crazy
I done, I done made it
I done made it, made it, yeah
I'm sick and tired of these hatin' ass niggas, though
Let my dick breathe for a couple seconds, man, shit

Army sergeant, no rank, yeah, okay If you ain't payin' a hundred thousand, get them features out my face

We ball like Wilt Chamberlain, like the name of them old Gucci tapes
Yeah, I'm talkin' 'bout Gucci Mane

Yeah, away, away, away, away, away
You want bullshit, I hit you with that olé
Told my shooter I gotta prove myself no lame

Your bitch a dragon, she run up on me, she get slayed
I took a piss in your dead homie grave, uh 
Chicago shit, Chicago nigga
Fuckin' with a Philadelphia bitch
Yeah, I'm super rich, I could pay your rent, Rollie doesn't tick
Chopper with the tints, pull up with the tints, clip is extended
Never gave a fuck, never gave a shit, only gettin' rich
Limb by limb, forgive and forget, man, I don't forget shit
You don't know when to stand
You got it bad, man, come in, oh
Oh, baby, come in

Take your W, and if you feel you didn't deserve it, go get better — make better music. It felt cheap. It didn't feel genuine. Why do that? Why feel guilt? You think those guys would pay homage to you if they won? This is how the world works: He made a brand of music that appealed to more people than me, Hov, Kanye and Kendrick. Whether people wanna say it's racial, or whether it's just the fact that he tapped into something we can't tap into. That's just how the cards fall. Own your shit To name just Kendrick? That shit made me feel funny. No, in that case, you robbed everybody. We all need text messages!

Dude, that's some cold shit, ain't it huh?

V-Town, California where I was born, raised and grown

Nigga charge it to the triple beam
Fuck the stress
I let that orange box of baking soda do the rest
Holler at my neighborhood chef, Raul
Known for cloning chickens and turning one into two
That's all he do for a living
That's all he's used to
Playtex rubber dishwashing gloves and residue, Biotch!!!!  Bullshit ain't nothin

With my faulty phone

She tried to slash my tire
Caught me in the bed with her cousin Tanji
From the track
She use to hold my sack
I use to dick her down way back in 86
She use to look just like a skank
But now that bitch got a ass, tits, body and boy that bich is bad
For what it's worth, the pussy smelled like Certs

Community service, put up stop signs  Uhhh!!! Hold the fuck on!!
Did you or did you not tell these niggas to stay within they envelope?

And put these hoes on the grind Ain't got to but I still touch it
Went to the Seven Eleven picked up a traders book and bought a bucket
Use to have a perm taller than the Charlotte Hornets

Going in, going in, going in, going in
Maybe just a little more
Going in, going in, going in, going in Juicy, squeeze it, then juicy
Sipping on the D'usse
Rocking some Medusa, give a fuck what you say
Give a fuck what you say
In the club, I wrote this for the plug
I wrote this for a hater that was looking for some love
A DJ competition, I'm mixing in the kitchen
Now who gon' do the dishes
Bankroll thicker than Deelishis You, you, you, you, you
Hate me 'cause I tell you the truth
Maybe your friends are confused
I'm gonna tell you the truth

Going in, going in, going in, going in
There we go, that' it for sure
Going in, going in, going in, going in
Maybe just a little more
Going in, going in, going in, going in Drug connotation in my population
I want a conversation, don't want no confrontation
Pull up in a hardtop, watch how I race it
Trap to the wrap like watch how I embrace it
Louis Vans on, they don't come with laces
And we talking straight shots, we don't need no chaser
Tell her I don't chase her, swap her, I replace it
Bracelet, this is Rollie, Rollie, this is bracelet
Pass the medication
Rounds upon rounds, I am nowhere around
I'm nowhere to be found
I'm on flights over lights, I'm so close up to Christ
I might ask for advice, I might ask for it twice
Look at my ice, I'm so nice, it's like Mardi Gras
Mama I shot me a man, please go hide the gun
When she ask me my number, I say I'm the one
Rushing summer to summer until someone come You, you, you, you, you
Hate me 'cause I tell you the truth
Maybe your friends are confused

Maybe just a little more
Going in, going in, going in, going in Go ahead and touch the sky
Go ahead and touch the sky
Dancing where you are
Go ahead and touch the sky The light is there See I come from Mississippi
I was young and runnin' wild
Ended up in New York City, where I had my first child
I named the boy Nasir, all the boys call him Nas
I told him as a youngster, he'll be the greatest man alive Let's go!...
Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey --
Chuck Berry of these rap skits, styles I mastered
Many brothers snatched it up and tried to match it
But I'm still number one, everyday real
Speak what I want, I don't care what y'all feel
Cause I'm my own master, my Pop told me be your own boss
Keep integrity at every cost, and his home was Natchez Mississippi
Did it like Miles and Dizzy, now we gettin' busy
Bridging the gap, from the blues, to jazz, to rap
The history of music on this track
Born in the game, discovered my father's music
Like Prince searchin' through boxes of Purple Rain
But my Minneapolis was The Bridge, home of the Superkids
Some are well-known, some doin' bids
I mighta ended up on the wrong side of the tracks
If Pops wouldn't've pulled me back an said yo See I come from Mississippi
I was young and runnin' wild
Ended up in New York City, where I had my first child
I named the boy Nasir, all the boys call him Nas
I told him as a youngster, he'll be the greatest man alive
Greatest man alive 
Gre-Gre-Gre-Gre-Greatest man alive! The blues came from gospel, gospel from blues
Slaves are harmonizin' them ah's and ooh's
Old school, new school, know school rules
All these years I been voicin' my blues
I'm a artist from the start, Hip-Hop guided my heart
Graffiti on the wall, coulda ended in Spoffard, juvenile delinquent
But Pops gave me the right type'a tools to think with
Books to read, like X and stuff
Cause the schools said the kids had dyslexia
In art class I was a compulsive sketcher of
Teachers in my homeroom, I drew pix to mess them up
Cause none'a them would like my style
Read more books than the curriculum profile
Said, Mr. Jones please come get your child
Cause he's writin' mad poems and his verses are wild I was born in Mississippi
I was young and runnin' wild
Moved to New York City, where I had my first child
I named the boy Nasir, all the boys call him Nas
I told him as a youngster, he'll be the greatest man alive
Greatest man - The great-greatest man alive Hey-Hey-Hey -- My Poppa was not a Rollin' Stone
He been around the world blowin' his horn, still he came home
Then he got grown, changed his name to Olu
Come on, tell 'em 'bout the places you gone to I been to Saudi Arabia, Mozambique
Madagascar, Paris, Greece
The Middle Africa is where we lived
Better known as Queenbridge Nas, Nas you don't stop
Olu Dara in the house, you don't stop
Muddy Waters' Howling Wolf you don't stop
From the Blues to Street Hop you don't stop
Tell 'em Pop See I come from Mississippi 
I was young and runnin' wild 
Ended up in New York City 
Where I had my first child 
I named the boy Nasir 
All the boys call him Nas 
I told him as a youngster
He'll be the greatest man alive 
Greatest man alive 
Gre-Gre-Gre-Gre-Greatest man alive!
Rest In Peace Ray CharlesLyrics From Snippet Woman speaking
CardoGotWings She say she know when I be tellin' a lie
She told me I'm like all of those other guys
Well, alright, alright
Alright, yeah yeah, alright
In my anxiety I'm buried alive
Some of your words are fuels to fire
Catastrophic when you ignite
Do you still want this? You decide
Well, alright, alright
Alright, yeah yeah, alright
Alright, alright
Alright, yeah yeah, alright Haha, yeah, mood change, mood change
You have a rainbow on your head
You got a mood ring, mood ring

I know I am not enough, that's okay, okay Ah, I'll be strong, make me feel like I belong, yeah
Ah, I'll be strong, make me feel like I belo-o-ong She say she know when I be tellin' a lie

Ali, mix it
Ha ha ha, Lady G, Whaddup?
Ha ha ha, Bad Love, Whaddup?
Ha ha ha, ha... I spaz out 'til I pass out
There’s clarity in my vulgarity for a sass-mouth
Your parody’s not funny
Apparently you ain't nothing but industry crash dummies
As long as the lord love me, I’m good
I could: be the best rapper but I’d rather be the answer that capture the violence that coincides in my hood
I should: stick a fork in this music business
But I’m too deep in it like pussy on my penis
Devil’s kitchen in Phoenix; that’s the heat that I’m bringing where the shade at?
I’m L.A. radio and good music, boy, I don’t play that
Ugh, Walking a thin line from thinking like Einstein
And rhyming like Rakim in ’89
Don’t wanna pack a nine just a mind full of wisdom
Like a man 99 years old locked in prison
Don’t freeload on my vision
Get exposed like an R&B ho with a sex tape hidden
I’m always for the business, forever you can feel it
Whether you Crip blue or a nigga that hemorrhage
My penmanship is like me and Langston combined to the hip
And my hip to the hop don’t stop as I rock
I got a buzz like a shot of Palmer Sun
And the women fall in love as they fall in my crotch
Now understand that I’m all that you’ve got
Give me chance, give me ears, give me hearts, give me props
Hear the difference? I’m cool like that
Oh, you spit? Well the retarded drool is back
See, I’m the author of the authors, the father of the Austin Power fajja
Who can bust like a charter, why bother?
I know a jealous serpent is a burden to my life
But still I carry on like luggage on a flight
The realness in my bones is the DNA to life
I can give you insight only if you’re in sight
I’m looking past y’all like a fastball - strike!
And I ain't even tryna give it my all - yikes!
I’m comfortable enough to go and chill out with a Huxtable
You couldn’t see my pedestal, because you’re afraid of heights
Cloud 9, where you can find
Me in my dime like Roosevelt in his prime
Wait 'til I’m in my prime
The moon and the stars will align on my Louis V. belt like Orion
To whom say he cool: but the irony is I could hold the bottom of an iron with the bottom of my palm
I say so much, so little all action, no talk like a mime throwing up gang signs
It’s not all about punchlines, I don’t do that
I’m a Jaguar; you’re just a new cat, now move back
Kendrick Lamar on the radar for success
Aiming for the top like an AR aimed at your neck
I can never digress, ‘less I get demoted to death
Even then I’ll be the best still, like a petty theft
I will: conquer my biggest dreams
Once you open the cage, I bet that I’ll spread my wings
Nipsy got street cred, Jay Rock got street cred
And all I got is bad credit, big ears and big head
But still they’ll feel me, cause we all ate cereal
Humped at momma's friend's daughter while they bump the stereo
Backflips on shopping carts, free lunch at the park
Watched Power Rangers after school; here we go
I’m so Comptonized, I will never compromise
For no faulty ass A&R or CEO
We ain't what you think and you think we’re back
But we’ve been here for decades, and I vouch for that
Open your mouth for that, speak well like a great debater over iChat
Get your other eye cracked
I don’t rap, I-Iraq and declare war
I enjoy watching enemies' blood pour
I came up lower middle class, not poor
So don’t feel sorry for me, I don’t need y’all to love me
I need y’all to feel me
And if you feeling froggy to leap, then feel free
My feeling’s all aside, my pride is deprived
By the ultimate prize I'mma get when I see your suicide
I got the world in my hands, the master plan
But I don’t know why I keep callin', why I keep
All of these girls at my shows, they lovin' me
But I don’t know why I keep callin', why I keep callin' you, hey All the models to the floor right now
All the models to the floor right now, what, huh?
All the models to the floor right now
All the models to the floor right now, huh? I’m in my Christian Dior with a Veronica Webb
Noemie Lenoir, Chanel, Sessilee Lopez
Arlenis Sosa, Selita Ebanks
Grew up on Mobb Deep and speak that Jourdan Dunn language
Make a phone call out to Joan Smalls
I wonder how it feel in Lara Stone's walls?
Jessica Gomes, y'all, I would damage her
And see if Jessica Stam got the stamina
I’m in the car with Leo and the Benz swerve
I heard Bar was friends with Esti Ginzburg
Coco Rocha, Kate Mimosa
Alessandra Ambrosio, Anja Rubik and Olga
Kurylenko, tell her I’m very single
Abbey Lee too, I’m a freak, boo
I’m wildin', I’m on a thousand
I wanna see Irina Shayk next to Doutzen I got the world in my hands, the master plan
But I don’t know why I keep callin', why I keep
All of these girls at my shows, they lovin' me
But I don’t know why I keep callin', why I keep callin' you, hey Christian Dior denim flow
I told her I’m tryin' to eat out, so what we goin' to dinner fo'? Miami nights, on the search for some T and A
Tryin' to hide what’s obvious to see in me
We conversate a bit about your DNA
And my salmon-colored suit from the VMAs
Oh, you was watchin'? Who the fuck wasn’t?
Me skip across that stage in five dozen, yuuugh
Six grand for a minute's time
Italian Vogue styled a nigga for a minute rhyme
Let's be clear and let's be fair
The best thing in music’s bein' offered here
It's a round table full of bosses here
Still givin' you it all like the coffin's near I got the world in my hands, the master plan
But I don’t know why I keep callin', why I keep
All of these girls at my shows, they lovin' me
But I don’t know why I keep callin', why I keep callin' you, hey All the models to the floor right now
All the models to the floor right now, what, huh?
All the models to the floor right now
All the models to the floor right now, huh? I got the world in my hands, the master plan
But I don’t know why I keep callin', why I keep
All of these girls at my shows, they lovin' me
But I don’t know why I keep callin', why I keep callin' you, hey It’s time for a lesson in model behavior
Damn, look at all the bad bitches I gave ya
Man, I can see the flaws to your flavor
Look like Wonder Woman and still need a savior
Maybe it's a billionaire, maybe it's that cocaine
I done seen drugs and money run the whole game
A good girl lost in the city life
Agent Provocateur, hold them titties right
I'm haute couture of hoes galore
Give my girl a Newport 'cause she's smoking yours
I'm the authority of model seniority
They call me Les but they all need more of me Uhh, handcraft material, champagne for cereal
Shorty stole my heart, criminal, my lucky charm, uh
Fly clothes and Lear shows take the stuff we on
Stuff all my problems in that bong and I’m puffin' strong
I been locked in my way of thinkin' now my cuffs are gone
Must’ve been the liquor talking, I’m beggin' the cups, c'mon
Might come off as irregular, I come in custom form
T-G-I-F, GT breeze, my hustler’s poem 
My sound’s full-grown, reminds me of my favorite chronic 
Ball like a SuperSonic, make the haters vomit 
Nigga, make some money ‘fore you make a comment
I meant to snap a while ago but who knows where the time went?
Probably dime chicks, whips with a Diddy
Now I’m back like a nine milli, running New York City
See me clearly through the storm, the world’s mine
Sits pretty in my palm, Chandon as we continue on I got the world in my hands, the master plan
But I don’t know why I keep callin', why I keep
All of these girls at my shows, they lovin' me
But I don’t know why I keep callin', why I keep callin' you, hey Niggas think they know, only got half of the story
They don't really know what's in my head fuckin' with me
How can I be better? I could start with just the basics
Dior, Dior galore, I love the cut
I seem to have forgotten that I’m off the looney
To the people who don't know Cud, know what?
Rose gold presidential on my boney wrist
Took my ma to Chanel, held Elsie the stunner
She got haters, some in the fam made us
But they don’t really matter, we escape 'em with our paper
Hey ya, I’m on my André 3000
I’m all good now, a nigga don’t need no counseling
Woke up in the room and my mojo was active
Looks from the hoes that were more than likely passive
Back when– let me not reflect on the old shit
I’m on to the new act, on to my new script
Bitches better have they thoughts before approachin'
I done heard it all, baby, save it for them other niggas
Doin' things off-beat for a living
Haters copy, I'm the image, hey
Haters copy, I'm the image
Alka Seltzer... in this motherfucker... I gotta take shit
Ay there go my book... I been looking for this book What, What... Yea I ain't seen as much death, nor seen as much crime, since the blackout in Queensbridge in 79'
Everybodies a killer now... pimps, playas, and dons
Shorties on the block, push drops and carry on
Niggas look through our window, where ever we drove
Through the tint, to see if the Benz is matching the clothes
We the Queens Kings
I used to view the cats that I owe... see things...
That made me real, but my skin and my soul
Girls who turned hoes
Friends who turned foes
Bad luck niggas who bring Death where ever they go
Never sleep, it feels better to know... it's all real though!... Everything Is Real... And... Where We Heading Now... Up to more Money... It be More Fun... Leave with Mo' Bitches... and Carry More Guns Where We Heading Now... Where We Going Yo... Getting Real Son... We Gon let It Flow... Leave with Mo' Bitches... And Be More Dough... It Be More Fun... Holding More... How the hell, are we supposed to excel from the street...
Where the Jakes Crew face young kids who wanna eat
Quantum Leap to this Black World, Hustlers, and Ghettos
Cell mates, millionaires, who tussle with the Devil
Bust a lil metal lead 
Wrestle you... to the pebbles... on the hard gound
That's if the God's down
It's a struggle, brothers jump bail
To come chill with they niggas on the block, with them rocks for sale
On the hard with the god Shapelle... a Queens Conrad
Yo run and come with the dime bag Yo, Yo-Yo
Ayo I need dat
I got to smoke dat...
Sell me some Chunky Black So I could smoke away the pain
Try to find my brain
But the thought still remain
Yo it's on again
Once the jail take these chains
Cause I been through it
The drug game I thought I knew it
I got knocked, went to trial
But I blew it
25... but only lived 20 years of my life
Took 5 from me
Got me wrapped up like a Mummy
Now I'm in the system... aka the Devil's Home
Where they tell you where to eat, sleep, shit, and use the phone
Now I'm living with... drug dealers, and chain stealers...
Bitch niggas, who got knocked and turned squealers
Imagine sharing a cell with a rehabilitated addict
Who love fucking with faggots
But I sip alot of Savage
I sat him down, and made him study mathematics
Now I'm sitting in the cell thinking...
About this reefer I'm a get this weekend
On the V.I. 
I rather be... uh, dam, dam 
Yo Hip-Hop, Is niggas still talkin bout I can't rap, come on now Look for me, Young K
Took 2Pac beat and got paid
My favorite rapper is Makaveli, Nas and Jay-Z
Eminem, Mase, Biggie Smalls and me
Now if you was my girlfriend you don't need no guyfriend
He could get his head bust nigga ain't my friend
Why the hell you lying who the hell you trying
Who the hell you know that threw away his throwbacks
When they suggested they was made by Majestic
My Answers cost 350, ya nah'mean?
Doesn't even have got her number we ain't on the same team
You got the hat the jacket shoelaces to match
I got the gat ratching new cases to catch
I got my business manager erasing my debt
I mean my credit was so pathetic I couldn't get a debit
I fill out for a car but shit they always debt it
My girl come over try to help me shine
How you gonna help me get a car your credit worser than mine
But everytime I get a check you be first up in line
Told you bout gold-diggin bitch it's worser than lying
You better grow up before I blow up
Have weed rolled up when I show up
Matter fact we broke as fuck
Ain't nothing left to do except get tore up from the floor up
Shit that's how I knew you was my girlfriend
So I promise to never pick up smutts
In my Cadillac pick-up truck
They need to get they sit-ups up
They always be colder than you
A little richer a little thicker a litter older than you
Probably a little smarter so they can drop me some jewels
That I could drop back to you to get your ass back in college
So you can be where they at two years from now
But for now bartender two beers for now
The second one is for my girlfriend  All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend me and my girlfriend
 Down to ride til the very end is me and my boyfriend me and my boyfriend I'm talkin bout when we was in Nissan's no Benz or such
We wasn't from Switzerland but we'll still go Dutch
Greater man could prob picture like there go us
No styles just good times like they're so nuts
We always thought if we had dough we could do so much
Like you ain't got to save the roach we can finish the Dutch
Like we ain't have to go coach told you i'll be paid soon
We ain't got to sit in this emergency aisle just to get leg room
We ain't got to go back to my room
There's only one bedroom that I call my lair
We was V.I.P
Very Imaginary Playaz
But you was my girlfriend yea yea yea you was my girlfriend  Holla, All I need in this world of sin is me and my girlfriend me and my girlfriend
 Down to ride til the very end is me and my boyfriend me and my boyfriend That's Right   All I need in this world of sin is me and my girlfriend me and my girlfriend

Same dudes used to laugh at me
See me in the CL 6 with Haffa B
They know that money begets money so naturally
Me and Haffa could blow a couple of stacks hassle free
I'm like fuck y'all haters on behalf on me
Cause I could flood the city with a staff of three
I'm talking me and two part -ners in that Caprice
With no copies made I got the master keys
And fast cars, fast women, fast cash and cream
Could mould you rappers like plasticine
I have to dream, but dog
Me and success are two things you don't wanna find your ass between
*Back against the wall like a plasma screens*
The inside of my wallet is pasture/ past your green
And you are now hanging with the asthma team
Sweetie catch your breath while I smash the scene
I should leave Earth, nothing left to do here
Everyday is Christmas and e'ry night is New Year's
Say whatever, I never been concerned about who hears
Call my town Sparta and I'm coming with two spears
I'm telling you dog, always got the spring collection in fall
I run my bill up making executives calls
And with me, women be building these sceptical walls
But once you slept with one dime man, you slept with them all, uhh
Family, money, and music is all I ever knew
My necklace suffer from depression it's forever blue
Cheer up baby you don't see all this revenue?
I started the game at level two
I'm sayin'
Stop acting like teen girls are my only market
I parallel the Flying +Spur+ +Tony park+ it
And it's cool if you spill suttin it's only carpet
That's why I get my interior colour only dark shit
Toronto's where you livin' today
And you ain't making records that people are driven to play
I would advise you to really make a move, sooner than later
Cause these are only the joints that I'm giving away
You feel me?
I came in a porche
I came in to floss
I got a phone full of dimes
I don’t know which one to call oh
I just know I wanna floss
I don’t know if I should cheat
‘Cause I love my nina rose yeah I got a thing for my nina
And some things we did between us
Dem niggas acting dirty
We gon’ take ‘em to the cleaners
In a beamer with Sabrina
A daddy got the refill baby
Daddy in the chain game
He got it out in december
It’s a cold world fast brakes, no words
Even when I rap I have to spit cold words
Making niggas see my view Whoopi Goldberg
How could I get caught over if I had a chauffeur,over
Treat the backseat like a couch
Treat these other niggers like trap roll em' in
Throw ‘em out realest here
Rep the south know the ends
And the out being like I got 3oh 3 at my house I’m in love with the bitch we clicking like a lighter
Take her everywhere I go because I’m not tryna fight you
Every touch a pop off you make a nigga like it shorty
Here’s a show off you don’t want to see the hive
But I can make the car squat I jam my niece with diapers
I’m shittin’ er’where like a dog with diarrhea
I scroll through my phone call my girl from Tanzania
And yeah I got the porsche she said I’m on ‘em and it’s me
You niggers park back like you play the sellafield
I’m hungry I got a taste for a different meal
I pulled up in that 4 door , oh no
Keep the 9 on me Tony Romo
Pass the remote I’m on I’m ’bout to turn it on
I saw you on something different than what I’m burning on
I was on the corner when I first perform
Wave my hands in the air and told all the cars

If you could catch Jay right, on the late night
Without the eight, right, maybe you could test my weight, right
I dip, spit quicker than you ever seen
Administer pain, next the minister's screamin' your name
At your wake as I peek in, look in your casket
Feelin' sarcastic, Look at him, still sleepin'
You never ready, forever petty minds stay petty
Mine's thinkin' longevity until I'm seventy
Livin' heavenly, fuck, felony after felony, what?
Nigga you broke, what the fuck you going to tell me? Jay-Z, Jay-Z, now you know this is a phat track 
Now this is comin' on your new album, on Roc-A-Fella records in '96?

But I know you innocent, and I'm behind you 100%. Mad Wednesdays, Ruby King, DJ Ace, Dame Dash, Roc-A-Fella Records, we all behind you, you can come back any time!

Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, Ace, turn that music down. I smell some reefer, now you see? That's why, our people don't have anything, because we don't know how to go in places and act properly

Wait a minute, wait a minute, who told me shut the eff up? Who told me to shut the eff up? Get him out of here! I'm not gonna continue this show, until you throw him out! Get him out right now, then I'ma continue my speech!

Ooops! Sudden stop, it spills on the walkie-talkie
Damn, this nigga is a creep
Whispers the police at the Wino in the middle of the street
With missin' front teeth twistin' blunts deep in the cut
It's my nigga so I holla what up, niggas good morning Good morning 'cause I'm still here 
I didn't get a wake-up call from out there

So I'ma head back to the street for a lesson
And only live by God's blessing Good morning 'cause I'm still here 
I didn't get a wake-up call from out there

So I'ma head back to the street for a lesson
And only live by God's blessing, good morning Good morning, yawnin', dawn is now gone and
New day, toothpaste brushin' my screwface
Follow the light, it's just a great feelin'
And I love life, every minute is pure healin'
Can't you tell I'm much happy nowadays
No more child play, livin' life the foul way
My man just came home speedin'
Tryin' to catch up with 9 years of no freedom
The paper say, They finally caught him
He back in, I guess street life got too borin'
Kind of quiet, half the hood is still sleep
If you saw the night before you won't believe it's the same street
Put on my 'lands and, leave the Phantom
Take the low-whip for a trip up to Pan Pan's
Scramble egg whites and turkey bacon
Ma, pass the hot sauce from out your apron
Uh, good morning Good morning 'cause I'm still here 
I didn't get a wake-up call from out there

So I'ma head back to the street for a lesson
And only live by God's blessing Good morning 'cause I'm still here

So I'ma head back to the street for a lesson
And only live by God's blessing, good morning Yeah, yeah well, well yee-aah

What's wrong, nigga?
I thought you was keeping it gangsta
I thought this what you wanted
They say if you scared, go to church
But remember, he knows the Bible too Now, baby, when I get you, get you, get you, get you
I'ma go hit the throttle with you
Smoking, lokin', poking that doja 'til I'm idle with you
'Cause I 
Now, baby, when I'm riding here, I'm riding dirty
Registration is out of service
Smoking, lokin', drinking that potion, you can see me swerving
'Cause I 
 I remember you took me to the mall last week, baby
You looked me in my eyes about four, five times
'Til I was hypnotized, then you clarified
That I 
You said Sherane ain't got nothing on Lucy
I said, You crazy?
Roses are red, violets are blue
But me and you both pushing up daisies if I  Now, baby, when I get you, get you, get you, get you
I'ma go hit the throttle with you
Smoking, lokin', poking that doja 'til I'm idle with you
'Cause I  You said to me, you said your name was Lucy
I said, Where's Ricardo?
You said, Oh, no, not the show
Then you spit a little rap to me like this
When I turned twenty-six, I was like, Oh, shit
You said to me, I remember what you said too, you said:
My name is Lucy, Kendrick, you introduced me, Kendrick
Usually I don’t do this but I see you and me, Kendrick
Lucy give you no worries, Lucy got million stories
About these rappers that I came after when they was boring
Lucy gon' fill your pockets
Lucy gon' move your mama out of Compton
Inside the gi-gantic mansion like I promised
Lucy just want your trust and loyalty, avoiding me?
It's not so easy, I'm at these functions accordingly
Kendrick, Lucy don't slack a minute, Lucy work harder
Lucy gon' call you even when Lucy know you love your Father
I'm Lucy, I loosely heard prayers on your first album, truly
Lucy don't mind, 'cause at the end of the day you'll pursue me
Lucy go get it, Lucy not timid, Lucy up front
Lucy got paperwork on top of paperwork
I want you to know that Lucy got you
All your life I watched you
And now you all grown up to sign this contract, if that’s possible Get you, get you, get you, get you
I'ma go hit the throttle with you
Smoking, lokin', poking that doja 'til I'm idle with you
'Cause I 
Now, baby, when I'm riding here, I'm riding dirty
Registration is out of service
Smoking, lokin', drinking that potion, you can see me swerving
'Cause I  I remembered you was conflicted
Misusing your influence, sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screamin' in the hotel room
I didn't wanna self destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went runnin' for answers
Until I came home

It's been a long road
Sic-Wid-It Records UNNNNNNNNNGGGGGHHHHH! 
Y'all feel that? 
It's real out here 40  I'm out here in the slums where thugs be usin, ghetto tactics
Like, choppin up candy cane
Sittin on top of a dried up JCPenney pee stained mattress
Whatever it takes to survive, see that's what I supply
Like slippin and slidin in the grocery store
And settling out of court
Soft white coke a black turn into hard solidses
Thirty-eight snub nosed pistol grip lay ninjas on they wallets
The saga continues, the struggle's just beginnin
And it's hard to look up to snotty folks, cause THEY be sinnin
'Pac gone, Biggie gone, Seagram gone -- and we also lost Eazy-E
One of the first gangster rappers of all time
To the most vicious and deadliest disease in history since cancer
To Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, tombstone
From the graveyard shift, RBL's Mister C
One love, to Rappin Ron and Plann B
Victims of the trigger 
Po' out a little liquor It's not the same, this world is crazy
We out here goin through it all
Everything must change, it's gettin shady
Got our backs against the wall UNGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHH, I shed tears for pain 40, some for anger
Seen bloodshed by crooked cops, and gangbangers
Feel my pain  only time'll change it
And fast money, cars, and bitches got me trapped in this game
And my lil' homies ballin, picture me fallin
And momma in the funeral screamin and crawlin
Is there a heaven or hell?
To ghetto kids in the anky only time will tell
And jealousy, and envy, come with money
While crooked, politicians, run the country
And it's a, damn shame to see my, weeples vanish
Now they teach us ebonics, what about english and spanish
I couldn't, live my life behind bars and gates
While the government play a game called process to eliminate Case #246, shootin in an inhabited dwellin
They was steady complainin about the dope sellin
But they ain't never been evicted, or convicted
They ain't never been subpeonaed to court, or arrested
Shackled like an animal for pushin rocks
Dang near choked to death by motorcycle cops
Pepper sprayed and laughed at like that shit was funny
Pregnant breezy threw down on her tummy
Do you ever think I'll ever be able to get
A chance to repent and ask the lord for forgiveness
Before he close the casket, will my son end up growin up
Without a father will he end up bein a bastard?
A bastard -- that's a good question 
I don't know, I don't know 
Uh-iz-I-iz-I-should I save her?

Who do you think you are?
Baby one day you'll be a star
Last seen out of state where I drop my slang
I'm deep in the South kicking up top game
Bouncing on the highway switching fo' lanes
Screaming through the sunroof, money ain't a thing
Your worst fear confirmed
Me and my fam' roll tight like The Firm
Getting down for life, that's right, you better learn
Why play with fire, burn
We get together like a choir, to acquire what we desire
We do dirt like worms, produce G's like sperm
Till legs spread like germs
I got extensive hoes, with expensive clothes
And I sip fine wines and spit vintage flows

Cops pulling it over, Jigga react militant
Speed off, officer told me turn the beat off

I'm raised different, react in situations niggas lay stiff in
Rookies blame it on the age difference
My subliminal flows, create criminal odes
Sing along if y'all with me, til the end of the road
I'm cynical, when in the view of the public
And this is because, I'm defensive when I'm in interviews
The percentage who don't understand, is higher than the percentage who do
Check yourself, what percentage is you? Can I live, for all my niggas with all white Air Force Ones
And black guns, stack ones yo

Why is it? Why don't y'all try to visit the neighborhoods, I live in?
My mind been through hell, my neighborhood is crime central

Ran into shorty bopping down the ave
On his way to clocking math then
He proceeded to show me a block of slab and said Ayo there's money out there I just got to have
When I catch up to these fiends I'ma knock 'em on they ass
Not to brag, sometimes I look at my life and laugh
How I think about school and it taught me not to grab
When I backed out, let one out, let the barrel turn
Holla at you faggots that it's my block to burn
That credit you dead it
I know heads getting annoyed and knew all
About a dope fiend before reading Donald Goines
Flipping boy and, using the right cut
One thing that's fucked up is bad dope that I can't pump
This slab gotta re-up and re-bag
Blend it in with the raw, bubble it fast cop more
Once I get it I got it I lock it, nobody pop shit
Selling twenties on my block, bitch, on some blacktop shit
What you want nigga? What you want nigga?
What you want, what you want nigga? Can I live...
To all my niggas that hold coke in they bubble coat

SippinWhen Doggy Dogg comes

Rhyme a rhyme and tap this
Sippin silver satin while we smoked on the pin head
A couch was a nigga bed
Mary kept a nigga fed
Twenty first a nigga, yeah that's where a nigga live
I'm on the GA and fuck the D.A
Why? Cause they railroad the homie easy
And just cause the didn't know what 
I'm on a motherfuckin mission to come up, come up 1 - I feel like givin it up
Weall like livin it up
 2 - When Doggy Dogg comes
You better answer 1 overlaping 2 We are living in a world
Where anything can go at anytime
And if you ain't up on the game
Then I suggest you rearrange
Cause change gone come
And it ain't waitin on no one
They got me plottin from the bottom
With the ??? ain't no stopin'
And all I want for Christmas is forty city hoppin'
Is the to much to ask fo', oh no
And I heard through the eastside you spend to get some dough
So when you get your funk, go take to the store
Take it to daddy rap cause hes a pro-fessional
Guaranteed to get your shit up off the flo'
Beach city rider you know, fo sho'
You see that what flossin' is all about
The tightest rider gone turn it out
Bouncin, swirving and looking cute
Dogg Pound out the moon, Johnny longing for soup  Everybody in my family is nervous and waitin'
How can I be patience?
Look at what I'm facin'
They ain't the ones that gonna be riding to the station
So it what it all boils down to just some inspiration
Interpretation, the conversation you had with the judge
Of all judges budge this
And put it in perspective all praises due, true
We are living in a world
Where anything can go at anytime
And if you ain't up on the game
Then I suggest you rearrange
Cause change gone come
And it ain't waitin on no one
For all the drama I done went through
To get this to ya
How do I think I was gone do ya
Have you been mislead, since I asked you all to creep with me
You coundn't be cause ever since its been DP
LB-B.S chronic in my chest
Deathrow doggystyle holding down the west
With a shot of what gangstas drink
And a took off for a choke off, the most kept my G's off a toast
And keep LBC singing yall, DP ginging yall
We and yall face it all
Times living it up
Snoop Dogg again and you know I'm just giving it up  When Doggy Dogg comes
You better answer 
 Fade into backround
Wouldn't have it any other way
Wake up gettin' money every day
Remember writin' raps in my basement
Now I'm up in Cali, every day a vacation
Still takin' drugs to the face
Pills full of thrills, take your sufferin' away
Rob your connection, you buff for a day
I bet you'd kill to be me for a day Take one perc, 3-0 to the face
Scratch my problems away
Callin' up the gang, is it a problem today
They don't catch feelings, but they'll catch them a case
Took your bitch to Cali, you take L's in LA
I just want the Rolly, with the diamonds in the face
Glizzy and the Goyard,  on my waist
Wear it around my neck so I look pretty when I spray
I put codeine , money gangster, pourin' up
If I tell him you a problem, he gon' fuck you up
He told me nothing gettin' between us and these fuckin' bucks
We gon' run it up, we gon' run it up
So much cash, we gon' need a dump truck
Tryna rob me, you such a dumb fuck
That bitch say she love me, she such a dumb slut
Say he wanna kill me, lil nigga what's up? Wouldn't have it any other way
Wake up gettin' money every day
Remember writin' raps in my basement
Now I'm up in Cali, every day a vacation
Still takin' drugs to the face
Pills full of thrills, take your sufferin' away
Rob your connection, you buff for a day
I bet you'd kill to be me for a day You'll probably kill me if you had the chance, huh
Probably cause I spent a couple thou on pants, huh
Probably cause I got your bitch to dirty dance, huh
Fuck her then I'll leave her, call me Dirty Dan, huh
She scratch her head, like she got dandruff
You is my son, like my name Sanford
Hatin' niggas turn me into Bruce Banners
I ain't Megaman, but I got two cannons
Keep a few cannons
Soundin' like a drumline, nigga, Nick Cannon
Said she had fun time, cocaine dancin'
She wanna go to hell tonight, Marilyn Manson
Marilyn Monroe, I fuck on a white hoe Wouldn't have it any other way
Wake up gettin' money every day
Remember writin' raps in my basement
Now I'm up in Cali, every day a vacation
Still takin' drugs to the face
Pills full of thrills, take your sufferin' away
Rob your connection, you buff for a day
I bet you'd kill to be me for a day
Celebrate, grab a drink and put a blunt in the sky
Worldwide, nigga it's 1999
Shit out of control, sign of the times
I ain't had this much fun since '79
I was only eight then, hadn't been to the penn'
Just a young nigga on the front of a swing
Playin' football up in Poly High
Too young to ride but it's still Eastside
Homicides didn't happen much, niggas wasn't rappin much
It's 99 nigga, shit, I know you strappin up
Hell motherfuckin yeah, nigga wanna see the end
So next year we can do it all again
Same dogg channel, same dogg time
Only the strong will survive in 99
So much drama and delusion, my conclusion is confusing
Drippin on my memories, twisted off my music
Tryin to make my people do things, oh yeah we do's it, we do's it
Here's my number baby girl don't you lose it
It's smoky in this motherfucker while we cruising
And Eastside niggas is the shadiest 
But them Westside niggas is the craziest 
Summertime on the grind, baby let me shine, let me shine
Roll with this shit, I'm cold with this shit in my prime
Nigga done time and I never dropped a motherfucking dime Be smart, fresh start is all you need
First thing first, cuz, stop smoking cess weed
You are what you smoke, nigga stop hating
That's why you broke and that's why we celebrating
But life's so hard on a G, that's what they all say
But somehow someway Better days ahead, Freddy's dead
And Betty said Eddie's a fed
Sweaty in bed with a nine to his head
And he fuckin with this hoodrat that he met up in dance
Betty gettin mad cause Eddie wanna share
But look at how you livin for a minute then compare
I love confetti, I always stay ready
Keep some killers by my side and some riders by the telli
I'm ready to do now, who now, you now
Eddie wasn't ready when they drew that, booyow
Two down, with just one gun
My nigga, and who said killin wasn't no fun
I sit alone in the zone with a face of stone
Live the life of Al Capone or Don Corleone
Tragically casualties and fatalities
And all kinds of funny ass niggas coming after me
My grand pappy once sat me on his lap and he said
Sonny get your money 'fore you end up dead
I never really understood what he said
Until my motherfucking dogg took a slug in his head
Cold way nigga gotta learn his lesson
Slow down and go down, shit you know now Be smart, fresh start is all you need
First things first cuz, stop smokin cess weed
You are what you smoke, my nigga stop hating
That's why you broke and that's why we celebrating
But life's so hard on a G, that's what they all say
But somehow someway, you got to make a better way

You got to make a better way

You got to make a better way

You got to make a better way

You got to make a better way

Better days ahead

Better days ahead That's real
I feel your pain nigga
I used to be just like you nigga
Before I got off in this rap shit
Shit, nigga did anything to get a dollar
You know, but one thing I never did do
I ain't never beg a nigga for nothing or ask a nigga for nothing
I went out and got my own ya feel me?
So from me to you, man to man
Better days ahead my nigga
Shit, keep the faith and get your hustle on
Cause I'm a get mine regardless
Nigga whether I'm rapping or on the streets
I gotta have it
Uhh, uhh, where am I going
Where am I?
Yo, it's ill Yo, my wife's tired of fucking me
Life tries ducking me
Luckily I find 'em just at the right time
MAC in my right arm
Tequila bottle in my left arm, like Christión
Watching my life go
Can't do myself in
Wolves in the night yo, Hell's men
Two revolvers, I can let twelve spin
Hop in my Benz, push it to the limit
Buck-sixty who wit' me?
My Cris', two L's, twisted blunts and inner conscience
Telling me that I ain't shit
No matter how much cash I sit with
Still gotta ask the Lord for forgiveness
My precious baby girl came like forty nights of rain
To replenish my adolescent brain
Blessed be her name, before her birth I was insane
So I drive to cool the pressure down, delay the pain
I ate from these poisonous, fucked up streets
Tasted larceny, it was sweet, I starved for more to eat
Though I took, that was to live, hope God will forgive
As odd as it is, the more I gain the harder it is
To maintain, bitches playin' games
Niggas snitchin'
I ain't saying names
But y'all niggas better watch how y'all slang
Lost so many close niggas
Drunk, almost crashed
I'm going too fast
Highway patrol will just flash
Lights in my rearview
If they stop me I hope they lock me
Instead they speed ahead
Yo nigga watch me I'm drunk by myself, gun under my seat
I don't want none of my peeps caught up in none of my beef
I'm a ride to the end of the road if I have to
Praying no car speeds by for me to crash to
Steering wheel in my hand
Trying to hold it steady
Anything in my way is dead
'Cause that's the way I feel, I am already
When I'm drunk by myself alone in the zone
Drunk by myself Heard niggas hate me, but I hated too once
Been in the shoes of a Wolf in the night when he hunts
For every shell niggas bust, we bust at ourselves
Can't tell them niggas nothing though
Bullets wake 'em up well
Take them to hell
Stick up niggas once ran up on me
My decadent lifestyle attracted sharks on me
I ain't your mark homey
It's hard to look straight
My foot on the brake
Spilling my bottle not even shook of the Jakes
Could hardly look both ways
Put out the haze blurry vision
Think about the time in my life before I was in television
Hella women
Jealous niggas up in my vision
Since we all hood niggas expect kilos
For what they not seeing is police expect Rico
Only if I could take care of everybody, intoxicated
Windows up blasting A/C going wherever instinct takes me
I hate it when I'm like this
The bottle's my accomplice I'm drunk by myself, gun under my seat
I don't want none of my peeps caught up in none of my beef
I'm a ride to the end of the road if I have to
Praying no car speeds by for me to crash to
Steering wheel in my hand
Trying to hold it steady
Anything in my way is dead
'Cause that's the way I feel, I am already
When I'm drunk by myself alone in the zone
Drunk by myself The reason that I want to be alone
Tired of all the things that went wrong
That would have went right if I would have did it on my own
Take another swig
The more I drink, the more I think bad thoughts
Fake friends who hung around who wanna bring you down
Not knowing who to trust, rumors about niggas coming through
Supposedly to shoot at us, not knowing what was true
Or what to believe, that's why I'm on the low lately
Choosing a Henny bottle over a friend, driving again
To keep my mind off that weak shit
There's love through it all
Things to live for
I swerve, almost crash into a wall
Think about the good
Find myself laughing
Turn the cell off, no way to be reached
Know I'm near my crib
Tryna see my way through the streets
Reminded of the positive, I take my drunk ass home
Start feeling out of it, can't wait to get out of this whip
Bring my ass to the crib
I'm tired... I'm drunk by myself, gun under my seat
I don't want none of my peeps caught up in none of my beef
I'm a ride to the end of the road if I have to
Praying no car speeds by for me to crash to
Steering wheel in my hand
Trying to hold it steady
Anything in my way is dead
'Cause that's the way I feel, I am already
When I'm drunk by myself alone in the zone
Drunk by myself I'm in hell, i ain't hell
That shit nowhere more to me
Ain't no fairy tale
Demons tormenting me
Drugs help me sleep
I need Strong
Fuck that weak shit
Lions And they A'
Got my stripes no Adidas
Percocet, Codeine you know how i bleed
Rollin' of a bean i'm a fuckin' fiend
I'm still in my feels i'm still in my feels
IIsee everything i see everything  I can't feel emotion, going through the motions
Imma pop this percy, with this purple potion
She know that i'm rollin, but she still goin
She know i'm a demon, had a god moment
All these niggas crazy thinkin' they can fuck with juice
Just coz' you  fuck with me, don't mean that i fuck with you
That's your bitch? Cool, she just fucked my crew!
Bape stars, ayy they was on my shoes
Thats your homeboy, he just made the news
He so basic, we just took his truce
Don't get shit confused bitch i rock Dior
10 toes big pole at my front door
 She want all of me
Come and play my sport baby come and ball for me
Hit my storage, baby come and call for me
I need more lean, fake a cough for me

 I'm in hell, i ain't hell
That shit nowhere more to me
Ain't no fairy tale
Demons tormenting me
Drugs help me sleep
I need Strong
Fuck that weak shit
Lions And they A'
Got my stripes no Adidas
Percocet, Codeine you know how i bleed
Rollin' of a bean i'm a fuckin fiend
I'm still in my feels i'm still in my feels
I see everything i see everything 
How we stop the Black Panthers?
Ronald Reagan cooked up an answer
And people say, “Oh, Ronald Reagan’s that president”
But type “Black Panther” and “Ronald Reagan”
And see what you get
Being that he was the governor of L.A
Ronald Reagan cooked up an answer
You hear that? What Gil-Scott was hearing
Why all our heroes and heroines end up on heroin?
Crack raised the murder rate in D.C. and Maryland
We invested in that; it’s like we got Merrill lynched
And we been hanging from the same tree ever since
Sometimes I feel the music is the only medicine
So we cook it, cut it, measure it, bag it, sell it
The fiends cop it; nowadays, they can’t tell if…
That’s that good shit? We ain’t sure, man
Put the CD on your tongue; yeah, that’s pure, man That’s that crack music
That real Black music
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la From the place where the fathers gone
The mothers is hardly home
And the maricóns lock us up in the Audy Home
How the Mexicans say? “We just trying to party, homes”
Who gave Saddam anthrax?
George Bush got the answers
Back in the hood, it's a different type of chemical
Arm & Hammer baking soda; raised they whole quota
Right when our soldiers ran for the stove 'cause
'Cause… dreams of being Hova
Went from being a broke man to being a dopeman
To being the President; look, there's hope man
This that inspiration for the Moes and the folks man
Shorty come and see his momma straight overdosing
And this is the soundtrack
This the type of music that you make when you 'round that
Crack music!None
So many niggas get fucked up in the game
See, that's where they get caught out there in that word Game
'Cause it's not no fuckin' game When you hear shells coming at ya
Hot ones from a shotgun, I bet nigga runs faster
Loose a shoe to get away from a blaster
Think about that casket—you don't wanna be in that shit
Quick to take consignment; you taking everybody's package
Money over bitches was the law you practiced
So you act as if money was no object
Spendin' fazools, trips for your whole projects
Epcot Center, linens for ya bitches, Rolies for your dogs
Now we in the mall, slayed by his bitches
Every day I'm reminiscing, how he was living, having fun
'Cause any day coulda led to prison
Not for a short bid, 'cause if the feds ever caught kid
It'd be like 25 years conspiracy
Another 25 for RICO, snatching up him and his people
He had his jeep bulletproof, silencers on the Desert Eagle
Flipping bricks in Gary, Indiana
He had it locked down from the streets to the slammer
Only trusted two things: his trigger and his hammer
Used to be a bum 'til he had a six-month run
Had a lawsuit, 30 G's, the case was won
Met with Mexican Hoyé, cop boya
Bought a barbershop, named it after seeing Sade
That's where they found his body, in a barber chair face down
Bullets in his chest, sliced apart from the waist down
Planned to sell his shop, stick Hoyé for everything he got
Take jewels and his pies
Fill his shoes with cement and drop his body in the tides
But Hoyé was wise
Even when he ain't around he got ears and eyes
Gotta stay a step ahead of this game to stay alive Always wanted fame, always wanted cash
To live fast, get the girls with the biggest ass
Fuck a 9 to 5, gotta drive a 5
Now that I got it, the hardest thing to do is stay alive
Always wanted fame, always wanted cash
To live fast, get the girls with the biggest ass
Fuck a 9 to 5, gotta drive a 5
Now that I got it, the hardest thing to do is stay alive Cokehead Sandra, she grew in Gowanus
Her man was large and Sandra was his baby mama
Stayed in drama, fighting with hood rats that he was fucking
No job all day, she did nothing
They son was 7-years-old, she really was a wifey
First should she would transport blow, overnight for a G
He paid up front, they laid up once
She got pregnant, she wouldn't dead it
She had a boy, named her son Infinite after his father who did dirt
She didn't know disaster would follow
Capsules and bottles of crack in the back of his Mazda
He let her drive while he drove the burgundy 5
He often talk about how he wants to murder these guys
From off of Bergen Street, had mad work in the street
Lifestyle, richest nigga, far from how he used to be
Never thought he'd rock diamonds; never took weakness for kindness
That's how he gradually grew
Did a favor for a favor—now the nigga in with the crew
And now he live major, house in Dix Hills next to Brooke Shields
With the cook and the maid, shit was real
Saved his first bills made in his bodega
Good luck, player sign on the paper taped in the window
Escaped from a would-be kidnap, and slept
Thought niggas feared his rep 'til he got wet
Woulda had the world in his hands, his girl did a scam
The owner's rich, is boning niggas to get rid of her man
Welcome to the game, baby Always wanted fame, always wanted cash
To live fast, get the girls with the biggest ass
Fuck a 9 to 5, gotta drive a 5
Now that I got it, the hardest thing to do is stay alive
Always wanted fame, always wanted cash
To live fast, get the girls with the biggest ass
Fuck a 9 to 5, gotta drive a 5
Now that I got it, the hardest thing to do is stay alive
The hardest thing to do is stay alive
The hardest thing to do is stay alive
They're rotting my brain, love
These hoes are the same I admit it, another ho got me finished
Broke my heart, oh no you didn't
Fuck sippin', I'ma down a whole bottle
Hard liquor, hard truth, can't swallow
Need a bartender, put me out my sorrow
Wake up the next day in the Monte Carlo
With a new woman, tell me she from Colorado
And she love women, she'll be gone by tomorrow
Who am I kiddin'?
All this jealousy and agony that I sit in
I'm a jealous boy, really feel like John Lennon
I just want real love, guess it's been a minute
Pissed off from the way that I don't fit in, I don't fit in
Tell me what's the secret to love, I don't get it
Feel like I be runnin' a race I'm not winnin'
Ran into the devil today and she grinnin' Hey, these girls are insane  Shoutout Megan, make a nigga cum in two seconds
It was all good til' no one wanted see me with her
Janet, shawty head from a different planet
Cool as fuck but I can't trust a soul, God damn it
Jasmine, probably taking pictures out in Aspen
High school, back in high school, she couldn't stand me
These girls are the same 
That's why I fuck 'em all the same, my brother
Drop my top in the rain 
No one feels my pain like my brothers
VVS in my veins 
Ice cold blood can't relate to no lover 
Please don't go insane 
Over these raggedy hoes, my brother 
Hundred thousand dollars in a rain coat 
Niggas steady hatin', call them Big Joe 
30 karats hangin' off my pinky toe 
Asking all them questions, why you wanna know?
Shawty wanted drugs, so I made it snow
Walk around, askin' folks where the blow?  Now I am insane
Demons in my brain, love
Peace I can't obtain love
Cause all these girls the same, love
Now I am insane 
Demons in my brain, love
Peace I can't obtain love
Cause all these girls the same, love The same, love
All these hoes the same, loveGo!

I’m buildin' up a house where they raised me
You move with me, I'll go—, look Don’t switch on me, I got big plans
We need to forward to the islands
And get you gold, no spray tans
I need you to stop runnin' back to your ex, he’s a wasteman
I wanna know, how come we can never slash and stay friends?
I’m blem for real, I might just say how I feel
I’m blem for real, I might just say how I feel Together forever
Good morning, good afternoon, good night!
I'm here to talk about More Life
One secondBrooklyn, and we don't quit
It’s like this yo, and we don’t stop
Jay-Z, Rock Jockey, check it:
I get deep and dark like ditches
But when I rap, I come off
Like death without the glitches
Never crossed the black cat
With the riches, I’m leaving
Stevie, saying no Wonder you’re superstitious
Beef, I’m with it, simple
Ya’ll can all get it..
Ya’ll don’t all get it
Don’t nobody of mind for this matter
Can gather the data
Until your mind don’t matter
I bubble like lather
Hustle like the lead-off batter
Cause all that matters is the money
Til it ain’t funny, you feel me?
When the beast screams kill me
Don’t jerk me boy, I rip it silly
I’ll let you rise, of course
But if you don’t fall off on your own
MC's, I cut off at the knees like shorts
It gets worse - if you don’t care
For my sick thoughts like a nurse
With no known remedy
I’m leaving boys and men
On bended knee til the end of the road
I lie low, forget this record shit, with one sale Yo, pardon me.. Check it out:
The nerve of these herbs
Ya’ll know who swerve
From the curb in the LEX
The best observe
I’m splashing, splurging
Dashing, that’s my word, you know?
Champagne glass is crashing, can’t ration
Used to having a whole lot
So dough - I blow a lot
Had a buck fifty while
You were still taking Skippy to school
Ran with one of them cats
That hides Tiffany’s for them jewels
Back when Duke was jumping
Out of cabs in Krush Groove
I was scheming and plotting mostly
Dreaming alive, but look what it got me..
Four cars and four hundred thousand shots later
You know what I mean? Trying not to curse, you know?
Trying not to curse up in this piece..Day 1 Day 2 Day 3 Day 4 Fall down
I ain't finna fall down
Fourth quarter, shorty, I'mma a ball out
Don't go to work, baby call out
Ain't no waitin', no stall now
I'm finna ball out
Fourth quarter, shorty, no call outs
Don't go to work, baby, just call out
 In the bedroom, all out
Percs on the counter
I can't wait to take 'em
Blunts on the counter
Can't wait to face it
Bad lil' bitch, yeah
She be my favorite
All my songs, they all on her playlists
I don't really know how to say it but I'mma say it
I don't really know if she take it but she could take it
I don't slow it down unless I'm in the matrix
Presidential brain that bitch like Sarah Palin
Here it go
I'm not the same nigga that I was a year ago
I thank God every day for this, a miracle
In the Trap House singing mingles, spirituals 
Aunt Jemima, best believe I'm in trap, goin' entry lining
Pull up on 'em with the Rollie, that's perfect timing
I guess that means that the stars aligning
Gonna sing like CeCe Winans
Changed shit just like the climate
Sit back in my seat reclining
I call that shit perfect timing
I'm in another country getting new money
My money act depression, yeah that's blue money
Feeling like I had depression, I was blue or something
Until I smoked a pack and then I blew or something
Listen to the way that, I flow on this shit is off the top, like a wave cap
Pull up on the scene you get knocked like the bass back
Put the Mac-11 bullet where your fucking face at
Eating good cocaine on a placemat
And that's what a bitch put her face at
Eating good cocaine on a placemat
And that's what a bitch put her face atLyrics to Drake's song Bad Breed will be available when Views From The 6 is released on April 29th. Please continue to check Rap Genius for further updates! Uh, uh
I love it though
I love it though, y'know? Put your hands to the constellations
The way you look should be a sin, you my sensation
I know I’m preaching to the congregation
We love Jesus but you done learned a lot from Satan
I mean a nigga did a lot of waiting
We ain't married but tonight I need some consummation May the Lord forgive us, may the gods be with us
In that magic hour I seen good Christians
Make rash decisions, oh she do it
What happened to religion? Oh, she lose it
She putting on her make up, she casually allure
Text message break ups, the casualty of tour
How she gon' wake up and not love me no more?
I thought I was the asshole, I guess it’s rubbing off
Hood phenomenon, the LeBron of rhyme
Hard to be humble when you stunting on a jumbotron
I’m looking at her like this what you really wanted, huh?
Why we argue anyway? Oh, I forgot, it's summertime Put your hands to the constellations
The way you look should be a sin, you my sensation
I know I’m preaching to the congregation
We love Jesus but she done learned a lot from Satan

I mean a nigga did a lot of waiting
We ain't married but tonight I need some consummation When the sun go down it's the magic hour, the magic hour
And outta all the colors that'll fill up the skies
You got green on your mind, I can see it in your eyes
Why you standing there with your face screwed up?
Don’t leave while you're hot that’s how Mase screwed up
Throwing shit around, the whole place screwed up
Maybe I should call Mase so he could pray for us
I hit the Jamaican spot, at the bar, take a seat
I ordered the jerk, she said you are what you eat
You see I always loved that sense of humor
But tonight you should have seen how quiet the room was
The Lyor Cohen of Dior Homme
That's Dior Homme, not Dior, homie
The crib Scarface, could it be more Tony?
You love me for me? Could you be more phony? Put your hands to the constellations
The way you look should be a sin, you my sensation
Haven’t said a word- Haven’t said a word to me this evening
Cat got your tongue? Lookin' at my bitch I bet she give your ass a bone
Lookin' at my wrist it'll turn your ass to stone
Stretch limousine, sipping Rosé all alone
Double-headed monster with a mind of his own
Cherry red chariot, excess is just my character
All black tux, nigga shoes lavender
I never needed acceptance from all you outsiders
Had cyphers with Yeezy before his mouth wired
Before his jaw shattered climbing up the Lord's ladder
We still speeding, running signs like they don't matter
Uh, hater talking never made me mad
Never that not when I'm in my favorite papertag
Therefore G4's at the Clearport
When it come to tools fool I'm a Pep Boy
When it came to dope I was quick to export
Never tired of ballin' so it's on to the next sport
New Mercedes sedan, the Lex sport
So many cars DMV thought it was mail fraud
Different traps, I was getting mail from
Polk County, Jacksonville, rep Melbourne
Whole clique appetite's had tapeworms
Spinning Teddy Pendergrass vinyl as my J burns
I shed a tear before the night's over
God bless the man I put this ice over
Getting 2Pac money twice over
Still a real nigga, red Coogi sweater, dice roller
I'm making love to the angel of death
Catching feelings never stumble, retracing my stepsApril 15th, 2018 Some people have to work within the existing consciousness while some people can shift the consciousness. often people working with the existing consciousness are jealous of those who are more in touch and they become hard-core capitalist in hopes of creating the illusion that the value of money is worth more than the value of time and friends. April 17th, 2018 As a creative your ideas are your strongest form of currency. You have to protect your ability to create at all cost. try to avoid any contractual situation where you are held back from your ideas. distraction is the enemy of vision. Sometimes you have to get rid of everything. everything you do in life stems from either fear or love. Fear often causes people to be manipulative. be transparent as possible. Stop setting plays. Stop playing chess with life. Make decisions based on love not fear. trend is always late April 18th, 2018 when you first wake up don't hop right on the phone or the internet or even speak to anyone for even up to an hour if possible. Just be still and enjoy your own imagination. It's better than any movie. You have the best ideas. Other people's opinions are usually more  distractive than informative. Follow your own vision. base your actions on love. Do things you love and if you don't absolutely love something stop doing it as soon as you can. Don't follow crowds. Follow the innate feelings inside of you. Do what you feel not what you think. Thoughts have been placed in our heads to make everyone assimilate. Follow what you feel. I don't believe in the concept of an enemy. We have been conditioned to always be in competition. Stop looking for something to beat and just be. You don't have to do all the work. Once you start moving in love the universe will assist you. You will be a drop of water with the ocean as your army. If you move out of fear than your on your own. Then it's just you and the money and the countless people you have to lie to and manipulate to build a man made path that will never lead to true happiness. just stop lying about shit. Just stop lying. in life, we are all trained actors. When we're born we're ourselves and then one of the first things we're thought is how to act.  If you see a kid screaming at a restaurant because he feels something and can't express himself in a conventional manner. everyone will say he needs to learn how to act. At home parental acting classes are one of the first steps to us loosing who we really are to the simulation.  Parents are our first acting coaches. me and my friend Anthony Schiller always ask questions about time. Is time linear? I recently did an interview where I placed a high value on time. Everything means nothing until you make it something. You are your validator. Be here now. Be in the moment. The now is the greatest moment of our lives and it just keeps getting better. The bad parts the boring parts the parts with high anxiety. Embrace every moment for its greatness. This is life. This is the greatest movie we will ever see. There's love stories.  Pain happiness. It's 3 dementional. There's taste touch sound. It's the most entertaining for of entertainment. Just being. We believe time is a man made construct. Actually time and money are both man made currency. Because you can spend them both. too much emphasis is put on originality. Feel free to take ideas and update them at your will all great artist take and update. Cars have four wheels. Hoodies have hoods. It's amusing to me when some one says this is an original hoodie. Bro... it's a hoodie 🤷‍♂️ I find myself getting stuck in the idea of originality and letting my ego push me to say things like this person stole this from me and the funny thing is it'll be a reference I took from somewhere 😂 let's be less concerned with ownership of ideas. It is important that ideas see the light of day even if you don't get the credit for them. Let's be less concerned with credit awards and external validation. don't trade your authenticity for approval truth is my goal. Controversy is my gym. I'll do a hundred reps of controversy for a 6 pack of truth if you wanna see the true character of person watch the way they treat someone who can't do anything for them. April 19th, 2018 today will be the greatest day so far. Life keeps getting better and better. we're all servants it's not where you take things from.  It's where you take them to the beauty is in the imperfection April 20th, 2018 we need to Aman Giri the world people are celebrating real ideas and vibe. Not just hype all you have to be is yourself I don’t believe in horizontal hierarchy. If you build a ladder too high it’s actually most dangerous for the people at the top. images are limitless and words aren't. Words are defined sharing is community holding information is capitalism iterations of ideas are how culture evolves. everything is so planned these days. People appreciate spontaneity and honesty. strive for universal consciousness not segregated consciousness style is genderless Yeezy is based in Calabasas but will also be setting up offices in New York London and Wyoming the world is our office April 21st I love the way Candace Owens thinks. only free thinkers I don't subscribe the term and concept of God fearing.  That's a dated mentality that was used to control people. We are in the future. If God is love and love it's the opposite of fear then...🤔🤷‍♂️ to fear God makes no sense 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️ live in love not in fear. be fearless. Express what you feel not what you've been programmed to think. get past the past The more people contribute to real time global consciousness the faster we evolve April 22nd question everything the blinders are off Demonization has metastasized. The psychological zombie effect. People demonize people and then they demonize anybody who sees anything positive in someone whose been demonized we have freedom of speech but not freedom of thought. The thought police want to suppress freedom of thought. Constantly bringing up the past keeps you stuck there We live in a time where people don’t respect people for being themselves. People respect people for following the general  trend and consensus. There was a time when slavery was the trend and apparently that time is still upon us. But now it's a mentality. self victimization is a disease April 23 we're evolving at warp speed new ideas will no longer be condemned by the masses. We are on the frontier of massive change. Starting from breaking out of our mental prisons. life is more exciting than the movies even Prince once had an access pass everyone should be their own biggest fan I’ve always had a desire to do things people wouldn’t even think to do If your foresight is incredible   Stay stubborn to your vision you can say anything as long as you put the right emoji next to it. April 24 dragon 🐉 energy
Natural born leaders
Very instinctive
Great foresight to be great is to be misunderstood never a master. Always a student. 2024 spread love April 25 Free thinkers don't fear retaliation for your thoughts.  The traditional thinkers are only using thoughts and words but they are in a mental prison. You are free. You've already won. Feel energized. Move in love not fear. Be afraid of nothing. You don't have to agree with trump but the mob can't make me not love him. We are both dragon energy. He is my brother. I love everyone. I don't agree with everything anyone does. That's what makes us individuals. And we have the right to independent thought. If your friend jumps off the bridge you don't have to do the same. Ye being Ye is a fight for you to be you. For people In my life the idea of Trump is pretty much a 50 50 split but I don't tell a Hillary supporter not to support Hillary
I love Hillary too. I love when people have their own ideas. You don't have to be allowed anymore. Just be. Love who you want to love.  That's free thought. I'm not even political. I'm not a democrat or a republican And also I'm all the way out the sunken place. And I'm not scared anymore. I'm not scared of the media. I'm not scared of the past and I'm optimistic about the future. This tweet is in love not fear. with love I am invincible. Truth is subjective but love is the most powerful force in the world and the world needs to express more of it. I said express love more because we have love but we don't express it.  My friend Tmills will always say I love you and it used to make me feel weird to hear that. Now I tell everyone I love them.  He sparked me to start expressing love more. When my daughter acts out she actually says afterwards I just want to hear you say I love you more. no race religion region or political party can argue with the power of love fear takes strategy   Unlearn linear thinking   Hit you with these zig zag thoughts decentralize burn that excel spread sheet 🔥😂 whenever someone mentions the word fan to me it's super manipulative. It's like don't do or say this because of your fans  My fans are fans of themselves. And any fan of me wants Ye to be Ye even when they don't agree because I represent the fact that they can be themselves even when people don't agree with them. Drops mic 🎤Yeezy shrug 🤷‍♂️ April 26th, 2018 Though hate is a similar emotion to love. Hate is not the answer.  Love is. just think of someone you hate and try saying even to yourself that you love that person. The world is our family People usually don't agree with people who don't agree with them if you feel something don't let peer pressure manipulate you the concept of loving people has a stigma. try telling people you love them it actually feels weird at first. We're really good at hating each other. We have to get good at loving each other. Your conscience should allow a physical manifestation of your subconscious but right now most peoples conscious is too affected by other people’s thoughts and it creates a disconnect from you doing what you actually feel now. Instead of doing what you feel you just do what other people think you should do. it's really cool to say I hate you. But it's not cool to say I love you. Love has a stigma we are more worried about what we can lose than what we feel spread love. Put more love into the universe. Artist transform tragedy into beauty April 27th, 2018 April 28th, 2018 April 29th, 2018 April 30th, 2018 May 1, 2018 May 2, 2018 May 3, 2018 May 4, 2018 

Uh, that felt good
Does it baby?
Yeah, rub my back for me
Where do you want me to rub it baby?
Right here
Okay
Oh
Turn around
Aight, check it out though
Why don't you put me on some music?
What you wanna hear baby?
Put me on some of that old gangsta shit
Aight then

Damn, the fuck is that?
Every time I'm chilling someone ringing my motherfucking doorbell
You want me to get that for you?
Yeah, handle that shit for me
Aight, I'll be right back What the fuck?
Hey, Snoop!
Yo, what's up, Snoop Dogg? Hey, hey, hey Snoop, what's going down?
What's up G-Dogg?
Oh, nothing, trying to live between the sky and Earth and ain’t touching dirt nowhere, man
Right, right
I'm fucked about right about now Dogg
I'm about ready to get up out this, damn
I'm ready to get his shit up, man
With the motherfucking law after me
Punk-ass bitches, sucka-ass niggas
I can't take this shit no more dog
What? Man, you want to get out the game? Come on man
You can smoke a pound of bud everyday
You got a big screen TV, man, you wanna give all this up?
You got the dopest shit out on the streets
Nigga, is you crazy? That's the American Dream, nigga
Well, ain't it?
Fool, you better come on in
Wait, wait, wait, wait, hold up Snoop
Hey, nigga, I put five dollars on the weed
You better quit fucking with me 
It's time to get busy in this motherfucker
Like we always do about this time
Nah, what you get outta, outta not writing your stuff down on paper, you get the more-you know the...expression, the feeling yourself. You know what you want to say; instead of reading a paper that sounds read, it sounds narrated. Unless you wanna do it narrated... What if a dream was reality and reality was a dream?
And as complicated as it seems, if things we imagined actually happened?
And real life situations was artificial
They say we only living to, die
Imagine if we're already dead, waiting to live, living in hell
Trying to cross over to heaven we're confusing ourselves
Planet earth's like Oceans 11, we're plottin' for the getaway When my childhood friends get sent away to prison on their first offense
It's fucked up but listen, we study God but don't know him
Criticize people that work on Sundays, two jobs just to feed their kids
Well, momma's scratching lottery tickets knowing that it's just a fairy tale
Cus' we ain't gonna win
Every time that she's bubblin' in, it feels like the devil's holding a pen

Don't mind me I'm just thinking again
Thinking out loud, thinking the opposite of proud
Cus' I'm disappointed at my self sometimes
Self-esteem gets lower than night strippers
Hard to motivate the right rhymes, inspired by true crimes
It's not a game, it's nothing to play with
Turn it off then come back the next day, it's here to stay
Struggle that is
I'm so infatuated with knowing something that's waiting after this life
That means what I'm thinking is right
Punch, loop the beat for a minute
Moment of silence for J. Dilla, he on his way home
Know he see me spillin' my heart, hope for it soon
Wait a minute K. Dot! you said turn it back on, bring it back
If dreams was reality
If it was cool for you to be a casualty
The only way that you can escape poverty
Say that I'm weird but obviously you didn't get it when I said it the first time
You're listening too far if you hear this part
I suggest you go back and press rewind
I fast forward to common thoughts of a human
Deep in my thoughts like Patrick Ewing in the paint
Look what I brought to my state that they can't bring - the industry need a fix
Stick heroin needles inside politics, this is crack music
O-pi-um, inside the veins of them, I don't abuse it
Capture each moment like film, photo-shooting all my enemies moving
Direct them to a casket
Give it to 'em only if they ask for it, if they want...
If they wanna see reality 
I'm losing you again ain't I?
Ain't I, the perfect candidate to represent the fifty states?
Black President, they don't wanna see that
It's evident...pain is pain
We only love to hate each other that's striving for great-ness
I swear to God that we live in a Matrix
Take that blue pill then we start seeing spaceships
Kanye, west-coast niggas do it the best
Bring each other down, crab in a bucket effect
We learn to live with it I guess
I mean die with it, since we're already dead
Trying to cross over to heaven, that's what I said the first time
Get it? Now little boy I gotta sit you down
Teach you about the things that we live around
Materialistic things that we buyin' now means nothing later when the dream kick in
Fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out... When the dreams was reality and money was love
What would we do for a buzz to maintain our sanity
Chasing the wind, striving after this vanity
Traveling, no direction, the aimless casualty
American dream or Scarface fantasy
Kilos of coke and the arms of black families
We use to it, our hearts draped in stone
A mother's dreams for her baby boy to come back home
Cus' he out pushin' that chrome, pursuing that cash
End another niggas dreams when the fo-fifth blast
Now another mother screams picking out his casket
Harsh reality, it seems like it's simple mathematics, it's not
It's trigonometry  divided by some real life
And he'll do it again just to get a mill' twice
The streets mowed him, can't make past that
It's not a dream it's reality, look where it's at 
What happened in Manhattan happens all the time
In the hood, conspiracy to cover up crime
No nickel and dime, one shot pettiness
I wrote it in my mind as a letter to the president
World trade happened on the world stage
Same stage look at us as some educated apes
On video stations women gyrating
Parading around, mind-raping the youth
Fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out... What if a dream was reality and reality was a dream?
And as complicated as it seems, if things we imagined actually happened?
And real life situations was artificial
They say we only living to, die
Imagine if we're already dead, waiting to live, living in hell
Trying to cross over to heaven we're confusing ourselves
Planet earth's like Oceans 11, we're plottin' for the getaway I'm the man up in this piece! You'll never see the light of da..
Who the fuck d'ya think you fuckin' with? I'm the police!
I run shit here, you just live here!
When the sun fall out the sky
All I have is me in the land of do or die
A freeway, a gas pedal, and a peace of mind
Now, that's the ultimate high
To the cloud I go, cloud I go
One time, baby tell me ya need me
Cloud I go, cloud I go
Two time, baby tell me ya love me Cause I've been drinking too much, thinking too much
We ain't been keeping in touch
Fell into lust, where is the love?
My independency got tendencies of lack of trust
I look at the street corners as my new woman
Seductive as she want to be, hands all on my garments
And luckily, being in denial ain't the case
Cause I know she's unfaithful
Instead I'm grabbing her waist
And every part of her is tasteful
I know you're feelings hating
In fact, you think I'm ungrateful.. I know
Selfish as I wanna be and every time you under me
I get the vibe you might need some time to grow When the sun fall out the sky
All I have is me in the land of do or die
A freeway, a gas pedal, and a peace of mind
Now, that's the ultimate high
To the cloud I go, cloud I go
One time, baby tell me ya need me
Cloud I go, cloud I go
Two time, baby tell me ya love me Cause I been drinking too much, thinking too much
We ain't been keeping in touch
And every time that I think of your touch
Adrenaline pump, give me that rush
I'm going like a thief inside the wind
Lord forgive me for my sins
I know she want me more, but I fiend for benjamins
She said I found the root of all evil
And lost a friend
Lost in the world of a young boy from Compton
That never knew love because love was never promised
I know.. selfish as I wanna be
And every time I'm under you, me too
Need time to grow.. When the sun fall out the sky
All I have is me in the land of do or die
A freeway, a gas pedal, and a peace of mind
Now, that's the ultimate high
To the cloud I go, cloud I go
One time, baby tell me ya need me
Cloud I go, cloud I go
Two time, baby tell me ya love me Call me whip it back and forth
Mister get it off the porch
Ima hit 'em with the torch
Getting money is a sport
Talk and dance e'ry day
Mama taking me back and forth to court Uh
It ain't gotta be over no skrilla
Man a dummy'll kill ya
Eat you up with the rototiller
Nobody can heal ya
Welcome to the mind of the fried and burnt
Cali-harm-ya life souped up and turnt
No ski mask, bare faced and all
Been looking for him for years, finally seen him in sol
A chance he prob'ly never would have got if it was night
There at an intersection, two active cameras at the stoplight
Disobedient and hardheaded
As you can see and can tell
School and education he failed
But in the streets he prevailed
His grandma used to always yell:
Slow down sonny or you gonna end up going to hell
And you gonna burn for eternity.
Forever?
Yeah, eternity.
Man G-O-D don't give a mother-fuck about me!
The mind-frame of a youngster
Depended on who he up under
Now the choir at his funeral singing Going Up Yonder Can't nobody melt me
Fuck who never felt me
'Til somebody shelf me I'm the sickest nigga healthy
There's nothing you can tell me
Dice don't fail me
These hoes want to nail me
You niggas don't smell me
Can't stay up out of jail and he
Back and forth to court
Seen him in downtown Vallejo
He be: Cousin you got a 'port?
I said: Brodie I don't smoke.
He said: It's cool,
Showed me a 40-cal torch
Lil nigga you a fool.
Getting money be the sport
So we ball like Laveranues
Grown men clips yet
And bitches looking thirty-ish
Everybody clean but we do suckers the dirtiest
Nice with the flow everything I spit is courteous
But still I move mean like road rage
Give a nigga that gas, he need Rolaids
Magazine, homie, you could get a whole page
Stay up in a bad bitch's mouth like Colgate Make a dope fiend my spokesman
Give him a bump of this 
Get him going, he'll be back and then he spendin' chips 
Sucker repellent, stay far from me 
You from that area that snitch from ? 
.357 stainless snub
If they fire it'll wake a nigga's game up
I got two P's of green 
I need a coke connection 
Back, forth and forth
Cookin' in the kitchen, pitchin' pitchin' off the porch
Milk like money, smell it through my new denim
My pants sag like my pockets got weights in 'em 
They got me back on my mailman federal shit
We don't need your weed got ? gang for a pinch
I got crack dreams, man I'm gon' blow up!
Ain't no money why the lawyer gon' show up? 
Say Earl, let's get it crack-a-latin in this bitch..
Uhh.. nigga nigga.. y'know  y'know!
Uhh, Ice Cube and E-40 up in this motherfucker
 For those that don't know
We do it like this  I gotta say some shit 'fore we start the single
I'm sick of motherfuckers bitin 40 lingo
Everytime I see yo' bitch ass you got a jingle
And you ain't wrote shit, got it from my people
Your whole ego, is evil, negro, fo'rizzo, we go
Get the Desert Eagle, blast on your Regal
Your dub, no California Love, California slugs
From California bloods, and Calfironia cuz Dip ridin them little itty bitty ass wheels
In the town like you might see on shoppin carts
If I ain't ridin mustard or mayonnaise-zinas
And bowed toes,  low on horse
Then I'm bluffin, I'm less than nothin, a constipated dude
Constantly fartin, but I'm really supposed to be, shittin on fools
Peep - Ice Cube and E-40 doin a track together
That's HEAT! Players it don't get no better than this pimpin
That's HEAT! Two of the most grizzliest and Godzilla-ass niggas
To ever touch the mic..   Behind gates, heaven or hell, mansion or jail
Keepin it real, two niggas from the hood makin mill's
 Behind gates, heaven or hell, mansion or jail
Was destined to have somethin pimpin, be about your mail NOW! I might talk a different language but I'm not Scottish
Got more homies in jail, than I do in college
I'm a cold piece of  - slide through the park
And come back every fifteen minutes in a different car
On the strength of flamboastin pu-uh-purposes

Lookin' at the mirror, wondering if it's the same dude
Lookin' at my closet wondering if it's all about clothes
Look right next to me, wondering if it's all about
Hop in the car and asked the OnStar where this life goes
And I drive so fast I blur the light post
They say Drive Slow, I say I know
Then errrr, away I go
And the way I flew
In this year or two
I know this is what God put me here to do
But in this excitement
You just might miss
A shorty with a demo like Hey, you might like this
And see
He
Remind me of me
Just a year ago
Now he
Tellin' me
I'm his her-ro-oh
I took his CD and asked him what he's lookin' for
He said, Man, I don't know. Maybe a miracle Time, they say 
There ain't no way
Your dreams are gone see the light of day
Don't believe
That you can't achieve
Whatever you're after
You can't be swayed
By the simple minds
That wanna hold you down
And in His time
The pain you carry
Will be left far behind If you listen to the sermons
And ask the Lord for guidance
You will see the many blessings 
When you give Him all the glory 
Gonna talk to, don't ignore thee 
Listen to all the stories
Meant to sing Your name Don't let no one stand in your light
Change the way you feel inside
Nobody on this earth
Can tell you what your worth
Stand up, your the child of The King
And you can do anything You try to please everyone
Time to live your life
Release those old illusions
Stop wasting time and
Start embracing
His light and let it shine  when they say
 oh it ain't no way
 never stop believing in yourself
In the morning you'll see
All the answers that free
You from chains that would seem
To keep you standing still Don't let no one stand in your light
Change the way you feel inside
Nobody on this earth
Can tell you what your worth
Stand up, your the child of The King
And you can do anything I got an angel on my shoulder and I know he been warning me
To stay out the clubs where the police and warrants be
Cause that will lead to prison where the inmates and wardens be
But a lot of times we follow them when we know we ought to leave
And stay up in the party when we know that we ought to leave
But the women be callin' me
The liquor be callin' me
And what's the sense in Cons tippin' strippers named Diamond?
If he gonna be conflicted no different than diamonds
And the Lord is the only one that he can confide in
So I don't know how you think that you could deny Him
I open up the Book and the message is clear
But I still be in the hood so the pressure is there
To grab at that fast money just to get out of Queens
To bag up the work that they give out to fiends
But that ain't gonna work if I say what I mean
Cause at the end of the day I'm trying to Get Out My Dreams Don't let no one stand in your light
Change the way you feel inside
Nobody on this earth
Can tell you what your worth
Stand up, your a child of The King
And I can do anything Oh yes I can
Yes I can
I can do all things 
Nobody on this earth can tell you what you're worth
You're a child of The King
Never stop believing in yourself
The way you feel inside
Nobody on this earth
Stand up, stand up
And you can do anything

You in first place, you in first place
Bad bitch contest, you in first placeOlhe toda a merda em que você se meteu
Se eu te levar para casa,você começará a contar a verdade  Mãe,remova essa porra de bloqueio
Eu tento falar com você todos os dias,mas bloqueio de chamadas
Nunca consigo,eu estou no caminho para ''sintomas de abstinência''
Diga -me quem te disse que eu queria estar na porta
Para bater,eu só queria estar livre
Gostaria de saber se você pode deixar o seu salário
Para um advogado,eu posso dar a volta mas
Assim que eu sair daqui cada pacote será seu
Meu crédito está esgotado,eu preciso de ajuda
Não muito,eu vou lhe dar de volta o resto por mim mesmo
K.Dot me escreveu que matou Marcus
Se você me conhece sabe como me sinto mal
Keisha me criou falsas ilusões e nunca veio me visitar
E eu aprendi que uma outra folha preto
E os meus colegas me deixou no escuro,cego
Mãe volta pra mim pela última vez Mentira de homens,mentira de mulheres
Mentira de homens,mentira de mulheres
Mentira de homens,mentira de mulheres
Mentira de homens,mentira de mulheres
Olhe toda a merda em que você se meteu
Se eu te levar para casa,você começará a contar a verdade Mãe,remova essa porra de bloqueio
Até que chegou o dia em que ele removeu
Mas eles me deteram na mentira dentro do carro da polícia
Por favor,acredite em mim,isso não é fácil
Você parou de falar com o seu filho único
Lembra quando me colocou nessa carreira de relevos 
Eu competi,perseguindo sonhos de ser o melhor
Você me fez acreditar que um dia eu poderia ganhar
Tudo que eu preciso é você para me apoiar
A investigação da o mesmo relatório
De uma testemunha que pode testemunhar em tribunal
O promotor me ofereceu um acordo,ou perder
Mas eu não fui feito para todos esses números 
Por Deus,fazer uma oração para minha mãe
Se puder,pelo menos desbloqueie sua linha telefônica
Mãe volta pra mim pela última vez Mentira de homens,mentira de mulheres
Mentira de homens,mentira de mulheres
Mentira de homens,mentira de mulheres
Mentira de homens,mentira de mulheres
Olhe toda a merda em que você se meteu
Se eu te levar para casa,você começará a contar a verdade Dante,eu fico estressado por ter que bloquear o meu número
Mas um dia o estado me fez fazer isso
Eu posso ajudar,mas não muito
Se bem a sí mesmo,conhecer seu próprio fulcro
Olhe para a sua reflexão e me diga o que você vê
Quem é a sua proteção? Deus
Esta não é uma rejeição , eu só aceito
Seu destino e o que vai acontecer
Lembre-se toda a noite como eu chorei
Pensando que meu único filho estava morto
Eles olharam pela janela ,por debaixo da porta
Veja fechado melhor do que morto
A única vez que você pensa que eu sou egoísta
Portanto, antes de assumir o posto , e colocar a Bíblia na minha mão
Filho , deixe-me dizer-lhe isto Mentira de homens,mentira de mulheres
Mentira de homens,mentira de mulheres
Mentira de homens,mentira de mulheres
Mentira de homens,mentira de mulheres
Olhe toda a merda em que você se meteu
Se eu te levar para casa,você começará a contar a verdade Traduzido por Skaaaaazi!

All of my bitches be wanting to have threesomes lately I'm in the back of the back when I back out
Wrapped like a man inside of a crack house
Everybody know I'm a fashionista
Trap jumping up like Stackhouse
Everybody know what that's about
Swag up to my forehead, Miami from a  day
Drinking lean on a moped
Inner shake down for some romance
Look me in the eyes like a grown man
Seen a girl from high school
Busting moves on a pole dance
Southside Atlanta shit
Might boss the world with some counterfeits
Tell a nigga it's sold out, killed the game #PaulBearer
I ain't packing for some more there
Long money, long hair
Long nose, leave you long gone
Stretch you out like a lawn chair
Fuk u pay me, kick your shit like Solange there
Comfortable like Hermès, drive a ho crazy #AirBags You owe me mula, where's my guala ?
You ain't got it ? We got problems
Got to send my partner them shotters

In the club ordering bottles, strictly for the models
Throw a band's worth of Versace, get on one side on my closet
Fuck the shit out of little mama and drive her Looney Tunes
Play with me, I'll introduce you to the Gooney Tunes
These niggas trash, sweep them up, I need a broom
The bitch's nigga she ditched on us and then met me out the room
Showed up in that trench coat, caught butt naked like Robin Givens
Sexy pretty ass ghetto bitch straight from out Memphis
Scream out that droptop : Fuk u pay me
You better keep that Glock out, boy you know these streets shaded
Where the fuck you've been lately ?  
All my niggas really want the money
We don't want nothing else nigga I promise
All my niggas really want the money
All my niggas really want the money All we want is the money
The Mozzarella Galbani
I got more guns than the army
Can't let no bitch nigga harm me
I got that purple like Barney
I got two bitches that's horny
They say they niggas is corny
They never there and they lonely
They bought a bottle of 'trony
And now they ready to blow me
If you know me you owe me
That's what I told her for sho'
I'm a mac just like Obie
Me and my cronies and bronies
Rollies and stogies stay with the fifties and forties
That's us if you smell smoke
Cookies the antidote
Puffing that rope-a-dope
My partner's they kinfolk
They rap and they sell coke
Bust ya head like a cantaloupe
In the summer a peacoat
My iPhone is jailbroke
Leaning like the Tower of Pisa
Promethazina
Sweatin' like we under a heater
It's hot in here
All them suckers that's talking crazy
They not in here
Never tell my right ear what my left ear hear I'm up before the sun up to work it beyond ya'
I break it in pieces and tell your auntie to run up
Shooters keep guns up, snitches get tounges cut
Talk to the peoples, and get your daughters and sons 
I'm up in the chevy, we bangin blow job Betty
I just whip up a 80, so hit my phone when you're ready
Turkey bag of the loud, we ain't fuckin with reggie
Trump the trailer with pounds and touchdown out the 
So c'mon! About to hit another Lick
'Bout a 150 bucks, for that tax on every zip
Girl, I got bottles of that lean, tax on every sip
Cause they got the Qualitest and I got the Actavis
So Im rollin' , thizzin' off that molly
Stuntin' , no one has another kind
My big homie E-40 put me on the Carlos Rossi
I stay younger than the muscle
Got the gang from Charlie hustle Pockets will advance, clear the room
If they bitchin' with the shit, than your boy don't approve
See, Hennessy, Bacardi turns the party
Backwoods pre-rolled, club get foggy
Niggas mean muggin', well leap then froggy
Though I see why you mad, her ass applauding
That's your bitch, she flip like dolphins
We gon' work out and bounce the bed springs
No credit cards, just debit and large cash
And a real big bag, smell like a forest
I used to sell weight 'til gastric bypass
Pass with a Mac that smack your car glass
Addicted to ballin', no Timbs, ate Wheaties
Learn from  he taught big gritty
King East Bay, E-40, boss leany
Money all there, your money Houdini Get, get, get down! Uh.. uh.. uh..
New York streets where killers'll walk like Pistol Pete
And Pappy Mason, gave the young boys admiration
Prince from Queens and Fritz from Harlem
Street legends, the drugs kept the hood from starvin'
Pushin' cars, Nicky Barnes was the '70s
But there's a long list of high-profile celebrities
Worldwide on the thorough side of things
Livest kings, some died, one guy, one time
One day grabs me, as I'm about to blast heat
40-side of Vernon, I turned while he asked me
What you up to? The cops gon' bust you.
I was a teen drunk off brew
Stumbled I wondered if God sent him
'Cause two squad cars entered the block
And looked at us; I ain't flinch when they watched
I took it upstairs, the bathroom mirror, brushed my hair
Starin' at a young disciple
I almost gave my life to what the dice do
Yeah man, throwin' them bones
Hopin' my ace get his case thrown
His girl ain't wait for him, she in the world straight hoein'
While he lookin' at centerfolds of pretty girls showin'
They little cooch; gangstas don't die, he's living proof
The D.A. who tried him was lyin'
A white dude, killed his mother during the case
Hung jury, now the D.A. is being replaced
Pre-trial hearing is over, it's real for the soldier
Walks in the courtroom, the look in his eyes is wild
Triple-homicide, I sit in the back aisle
I wanna crack a smile when I see him
Throw up a fist for Black Power, 'cause all we want is his freedom
He grabbed a court officer's gun and started squeezin'
Then he grabbed the judge, screams out, Nobody leavin'
Everybody— Get down, get down! Get down, get down!
Get, get, get, get, get, get, get down!
Everybody
Get down, get down! Get down, get down!
Get, get, get, get, get, get, get down! Some niggas fuck their enemies in their ass when they catch 'em
Weird-ass niggas who dangerous so don't test 'em
They make you disappear, this a year that I won't forget
Sold CD's double platinum, met mo' execs
Southern niggas, independent label, real killers
Know the business, ran Tennessee for years, now they chillin'
They had the coke game somethin' crazy
Sold music out the trunk of their car, that shit amazed me
Put me onto her-on blunts, sherm or somethin'
Took a puff, what the fuck? I turned to punch him
Southern niggas ain't slow, nigga tried to play me
I left from around them dudes, they cool but they crazy
Now I'm back around the old school that raised me
New York gangsters, we loungin', out in L.A. see
A dude wrote my dog from Pelican Bay
The letter say, Nas, I got your back, the fools don't play.
I rolled with some Crips down to a Crenshaw funeral
Never saw so many men slaughtered and I knew the ho
Responsible; the nigga still alive in a hospital
Midnight they crept in his room and shot the doctor too
See, my cousin's in the game, thuggin' and thangs
He plugged me with a dame who was half-Mexicano
Gave the ass up, I'm a mack daddy Soprano
She passed me the indigo, but the imbecile
Shoulda never tippy-toed, thought my eyes were closed
Openin' the hotel room door to let her goons in
But I moved in a manner on some Jet Li shit
I let the hammers blow, wet three kids
See honey thought I had somethin' to do with all the drama
'Cause I was with a crew that had her people killed
Called up my cousin, told him I ain't fuckin' with you
He responded cool, but told me out here this how motherfuckers— Get down, get down! Get down, get down!
Get, get, get, get, get, get, get down!
Everybody
Get down, get down! Get down, get down!
Get, get, get, get, get, get, get down! All I really gotta say is that
If that's how our people gon' get down, how we ever gon' get up?
How we ever gon' get up if that's how we get down?
A shame when you really look at it
My folk against your folk, but we all kinfolk
Somebody got to make a change
When a good thing goes bad it's not the end of the world
It's just the end of a world that you had with one girl
And she's the reason it happened, but she's overreacting
And it's all because she don't want things to change So cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you
That's the wrong thing to do
Touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you
That's the wrong thing to do
Talk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you
That's the wrong thing to do
Cause you'll say you love me, and I'll end up lying
And say I love you, too But I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
Something's been missing
You know it, oh ho, she knows it
Oh ho, I know it, we all know it
I need someone different
 We live in a generation of not being in love
And not being together
But we sure make it feel like we're together
Because we're scared to see each other with somebody else So cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you
That's the wrong thing to do
Touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you
That's the wrong thing to do
Talk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you
That's the wrong thing to do
Cause you'll say you love me, and I'll end up lying
And say I love you, too But I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
Something's been missing
You know it, oh ho, she knows it
Oh ho, I know it, we all know it
I need someone different

Triple beams and things and T-Mobile paint ya
Told myself - I need to stop pushin hop

The hummer and the range was in someone else's name
Hope my city's reputation for the summer's gonna change
I hope you stick around and see it
Cause if you ain't around I'll bring your chick around to see it
Until she catch feelings and I have to let her go
And when I park my car outside she'll stick around and key it
Repercussions of a cheap lash
Had me doing repaints, just to get em re-scratched
And get attached do insane things
Take new jewelry and put it down the drain things
But, that's just the drama that the fame brings
Fresh prince tryna touch sky like

Lust, envy, hate, jealousy—wicked niggas, man Yo, sit back, relax, catch your contact
Sip your con-gi-ac
And let's all wash this money through this laundromat
Sneak attack, the new cats in rap worth top dollar
In fact, touch mines and I'll react like a Rottweiler
Who could relate? We play for high stakes at gunpoint
Catch 'em and break
Undress 'em, tie 'em with tape, no escape
The Corleone, fettuccine Capone
Roam in your own zone
Or get kidnapped and clapped in your dome
We got it sewn, The Firm art of war is unknown
Lower your tone, face it, homicide cases get thrown
Aristocrats, politickin' daily with diplomats

The bigger nigga with the cheddar was mad dripper
He had a fuckin' villa in Manilla
We got to flee to Panama, but wait, it's half-and-half
Ki's is one and two-fifth, so how we flip?
32 grams raw, chop it in half, get 16
Double it times three, we got 48
Which mean a whole lot of cream
Divide the profit by four
Subtract it by eight, we back to 16
Now add the other two that 'Mega bringin' through
So let's see, if we flip this other ki
Then that's more for me, mad coke and mad leak
Plus a five hundred cut in half is two-fifty
Now triple that times three
We got three quarters of another ki The Firm, baby, vol. 1

All these other hoes, they be wanna-be's
I don't wanna be with nobody except you, you, you Missed the days I woke up, you were next to me 
Get a quick reply when you be textin me 
And you always keep it real, don't gotta flex to me 
So no matter where I go, I'll always need you by my side
Yeah you're down to ride
Bonnie and Clyde
If a nigga try to take you, straight homicide
That's on my life
Just be my wife
I'll give you the world to have you next to me There comes a day in your life when you wanna kick back
Straw hat on the porch when you old perhaps
Wanna gather your thoughts, have a cold one
Brag, to your grandkids on how life is golden
So I'mma light a cigar in the corridor of the crib
Pictures on the wall of all the things that I did
All the money and fame, 8 by 10's
Of the whole Rat Pack inside of a big frame
Colliding with big names that could've made your career stop
All that, and your man is still here and I'm still hot
Wow, I need a moment y'all
See I almost felt a tear drop When was the last time you heard a real anthem
Nas, the millionaire, the mansion
When was the last time you heard your boy Nas rhyme
Never on schedule, but always on time These streets hold my deepest days
This hood taught me golden ways
Made me, truly this is what made me
Break me, not a thing's gonna break me
These streets hold my deepest days
This hood taught me golden ways
Made me, truly this is what made me
Break me, not a thing's gonna break me Ohh, I'm that history I'm that block
I'm that lifestyle I'm that spot
I'm that kid by the number spot
That's my past that made me hot
Here's my life long anthem
Can't forget about you
 Can't forget about the old school, Bam, Caz, Melle Mel, Flash
Rocksteady spinnin on they back
Can't forget when the first rap Grammy went to Jazzy, Fresh Prince
Fat Boys broke up, rap hasn't been the same since
So irregular, how it messed you up
When Mr. T became a wrestler
Can't forget about Jordan's retirement
The shot Robert Horry hit to win the game in the finals kid
Some things are forever, some things are not
It's the things we remember that gave the world shock
They stay in a place in your mind so snug
Like who the person was with whom you first made love These streets hold my deepest days
This hood taught me golden ways
Made me, truly this is what made me
Break me, not a thing's gonna break me These streets hold my deepest days
This hood taught me golden ways
Made me, truly this is what made me
Break me, not a thing's gonna break me Ohh, I'm that history I'm that block
I'm that lifestyle I'm that spot
I'm that kid by the number spot
That's my past that made me hot
Here's my life long anthem
Can't forget about you

Can't forget about you
 Unforgettable, unsubmittable, I go by N now
Just one syllable, it's the end cause the game's tired
It's the same vibe, Good Times had right after James died
That's why the gangsta rhymers ain't inspired
Heinous crimes help record sales more than creative lines
And I don't wanna keep bringing up the greater times
But I'm a dreamer nostalgic with the state of mind
The past the past enough of it, aight then
But nothing gives me chills like Douglas and Tyson
Or Mike when his talk was live
Or when he first did the moon walk on Motown 25 When was the last time you heard a real anthem
Nas, the millionaire, the mansion
When was the last time you heard your boy Nas rhyme
Never on schedule, but always on time These streets hold my deepest days
This hood taught me golden ways
Made me, truly this is what made me
Break me, not a thing's gonna break me These streets hold my deepest days
This hood taught me golden ways
Made me, truly this is what made me
Break me, not a thing's gonna break me That's why, darling, it's incredible
That someone so unforgettable
Thinks that I am unforgettable tooFried Chicken • 1 whole medium  chicken, carved into 8 pieces

I'm holdin' on a rope
Got me ten feet off the ground
And I'm hearin' what you're saying
But I just can't make a sound
You tell me that you need me
Then you go and cut me down, but wait
Tell me that you're sorry
Didn't think I'd turn around, I say hey Okay, I'm talking 'bout a good girl gone bad
Crooked world, wrong path; right Mom, wrong Dad
I sing this song mad but not mad enough to shoot you
But it just eats me up, like some barbecue from Luther's
In the morning with the roosters
On the corner with the boosters
And she's the fresh-cut and they're on her, like sutures
And I wanna talk to her, but her momma has to school her
I wanna see her better, she's the weather of my future
I don't wanna see another hurricane
Baby, you can kill the pain
If you just let me explain, trust me, I know what I'm sayin'
You will end up on the track of an on-comin' train
Stuck in the passenger seat, travelin' through the fast lane Well, once upon a time there was a mom and a dad
Who on the outside, had everything people wished they had
A beautiful daughter, two-story house, two-car garage
And a white picket-fence wrapped around the front yard
See, Daddy was a doctor and Mommy was a banker
Mommy's job got outsourced, so now Mommy's a dranker
Daddy had a malpractice suit, now he's a snorter
And all this shit is takin' place right in front of the daughter
She says, Daddy, what's wrong?, but he's just too high
Mommy, what we gon' do?, she just get drunk and cry
Caught in the middle of two wrongs, tryin' to do right
Looking for answers all alone in the darkness of night
Shit ain't right I'm holding on a rope
Got me ten feet off the ground
And I'm hearing what you're saying
But I just can't make a sound
You tell me that you need me
Then you go and cut me down, but wait
Tell me that you're sorry
Didn't think I'd turn around, I say hey You say that it's too late to apologize
It's too late
I said it's too late to apologize
It's too lateTell us that you would like to have the lyrics of this song. Then we'll make it our highest priority to find these lyrics first!

Ex girl strippin', I can't stop her
New girl trippin' but I can't drop her
Cause I need somethin' to balance out the fact
That it's hard to find a woman when you talented and black
When you hollerin' at labels and they silencin' you back
Cause you fail to thoroughly discuss some violence in ya track well
Gunshot for the young yacht owner
See there's everybody else then there's one top loner
First place is often the worst place
But fuck it I love it here
I call it my birthplace
Whenever I walk in they makin' the worst face
Surrounded by Filipinos I think of the worst case
Watch chrome green diamonds I call it the earth face
I'm gettin' ya cake I tell you how ya dessert taste
I get a dessert plate
Y'all eat pedigree as ya meal
I've been Urkel for some years
It's better bein' Jaleel

Seat back
Light sayin' tank on E

To be the one and only nigga that you ain't gon' see
In the club with a model spillin' dranks on me

Second quarter I'm droppin'
With or without a label man I'm committed to poppin'
And take over the summer
Tour to tour hoppin'
I'mma meet a lot of women I'mma do a lot of shoppin'
Really no other option
Spend a lot of money just to make it back
Anybody I dissed in a song I don't take it back
Same rappers that's all in ya face sayin' Drake is whack
Are checkin' my availability just to make a track
I promise mama
I'mma do it cause I know I put you through it 
And I just want you to sit around with ya friends at the dinner table and say my baby's famous and I knew it And it wasn't nothin' to it
I'm drawin' and drawin' till the pen was out of fluid
The ballpoint run out
Then all joints come out classic
Rappers are fake we can all point one out Yeah
I'd like to introduce you to the first lady of the ATF Closer to my dreams 
I'm gettin' higher
Yeah 
I feel it in my sleep 
I said I'm gettin' higher
Yeah
And closer to my dreams
Whoa
Sometimes it feels like I'll never move on
Closer to my dreams Look
I took a plane to Hawaii with D
And we was trippin' off of the speed at which life progress
From meetin' Trey in Atlanta to doin' a cameo in his video has made everything right with ex 
I got too many records and not enough shows
Too many rappers and not enough-
Well
You can fill the blank in
They tryna be the best
Just tryna place in the rankin'
They can't
Play pen drop out
The gray ten drop out
Summer 05 with the gray Benz drop out
Charcoal charger
Racin' through back streets
On my Craig David shit the awful dodger
Showed her I'mma
I told her I'mma
Bout to get my run-on so hold the commas
Times changed now I'm older mama
And these niggas ain't solid they fold in drama
And that's the realest shit I ever wrote
A compilation of mental thoughts that I never note
And hi, haters
I'm back off of hiatus
How ya album doin'?
I'm gettin' cake off of my latest
Anticipated like the iPhone
Respected in any city that I roam
Summertime
Wintertime
Dinnertime
Anytime

Home Closer to my dreams
I'm gettin' higher
Yeah
I feel it in my sleep

Uhh.. regulate nigga
Bravehearts nigga
Live for this
Some of y'all don't live at all
Get yours nigga
Get yours baby
Uhh, yo.. yo.. As the night close down on the Earth like gray dark rings
Light of cities in the nights, destination for Kings
With big dreams, like Castro, overthrew Bautista
From Cuba, and pointed nukes toward the U.S
About to shoot us for revolution; that's how you gotta move
A lot of rules, some locked in solitude
Curse the day of they birth confused, who's to be praised?
The mighty dollar -- or almighty Allah
I'm like the farmer, plantin' words, people are seeds
My truth is the soil; help you grow like trees
May the children come in all colors, change like leaves
But hold before you one of those prophetic MCs
With blunted flows, seven hundred souls in me
Each channelin', from past to present times, heaven shines
Light on those, innocent to how the world grows
Some men become murderers, and some girls become hoes
And you accounted for, everything that you heard
Do not speak to fools; they scorn the wisdom of your words
My heart is wise, bloodshot eyes, the saga never dies
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners.. Yo we gotta be God's children, habitats in tall buildings
Rats crawl in filthy hallways, incinerators
Sinners who faithless, still there's hope, pray it's answered
Dreams turned real - what's a wicked nation?
One with blind men - not takin' charge of the situation
Empty arguments and real conversations needed
The world'll need it, to hear it
Evil tries to weaken my spirit - it's chronic herb
This hurt come from the honest word
I now try hardest to serve my maker, what I learned
Find it's way on the paper, so I could dictate it
Articulate it, luckily - I was put on one of the ships that made it
Through strong currents and winds that left the others stranded
To sink in the Atlantic
Satan jigs the planet, not to get too religious, but
Who decides when and if your life is finished?
If Christ is in this, for the sake of your name, oh Lord
May we break away from the chains abroad Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners.. get up, wake up, rise
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners.. You wanna buy time? I'm the seller of minutes
I give you every second low-priced, if I sold lies; the truth is
Time waits for none of you, in fact
He can't wait for the date to snatch the ground right from under you
Small visions of better life if cheddar was right
Lurk in the mind, of young ones ahead of they time
Trapped in the slums, beggin' for nuttin' but takin'
Headed for nuttin' but the state pen, where they cousins be waitin'
Judges is not relatin' to pleas, guns bustin' where the kids play
Richochet off lamp poles and leave damp holes
In bystanders, get cancelled, D.O.A
Around the way where we from
Hope the future reduce the rate of those buried young
Life is every man's kingdom, a dyin' man's past
And a newborn's, first time to be here at last
And shouldn't have to grow up fast, and suffer our pain
Hustlin' harder than the generations here before he came
Goin' through the same bullshit as our fathers
Readin' history, but who's the authors?
For some the game is easy, for most of us the game is much harder
But never lose faith; through the years just get smarter
Ghetto prisoners.. ghetto prisoners.. Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners.. get up, wake up, rise
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners..
Mula! Yeah, look
I'ma tell you all this last time, don't get involved
Bullets start ripping through the walls
Hit ya baby mama and the house door
We making house calls, I'm an outlaw, in the south ward
Knock your ass out if you talk stupid
Got a big dick so I walk stupid
She got that hit-it-quick-in-the-car booty
Hold on, bad hoes need to get a raise, lame niggas tryna get away
But all ya diamonds need to get appraised, you in the way
Too many nights I was out lurking, mine in the days, nine days
I'm on Ocean Drive with a bad bitch lyin' in the shades
Sipping Minute Maid, gotta penetrate, let me demonstrate
Got the Jones soda with the drink in it
Got a backwood with the dank in it
Party ain't popping if we ain't in it
Go Blake Griffin, might flex on 'em
That's too much sauce, I bet them hoes know who I are
They treat a nigga like a superstar and that's what I am
I got your bitch but that's my bitch
So that's our bitch and that's all cool
When you trip out, wan' dip out, she just call me and I fall through
And that's bad news, hold these nuts, cashews
Vroom, I flew past you, new whips here, what the bags do
Past cool, young Jones My enemies should get a good breakfast and a cup of coffee
I know refugees that don't rush things, they kill 'em softly
My closet still got Nike boxes and a couple corpses
Look, even though I'll never sell my soul, I got a couple offers
Don't think about it, I smoke about it, I drink about it
They wrap the body, then rap about it
Sink the body, then sing about it, zip the body, then sip about it
Fuck the world, I'ma still get some cool things up out it
If a CEO wanna dance all in my videos, I need a big deposit
Swerve, swerve, I'm back on 'em
My bad, I'm turning my back on 'em
I fuck, then see if Tune, Jay Jones, Hoody, or Mack want 'em
Real shit, I've seen good girls go to airports with that pack on 'em
Trill shit, I've seen bad bitches with good genes but I slack on 'em
I ain't focused there, Gotham City, got Batmans and Jokers there
I'm in the club but I'm in the cut
They got cameras here like Oprah's here
Since a kid, I heard gunshots, mothers cry, all the shit soldiers hear
So I had to abracadabra, voila, just to make hope appear
Young! Abracadabra, abracadabra!
We rata-ta-ta-ta, then disappeared, right after it happened

You don't believe in magic, but you know that I'm for real
Voila! Voila! Ta-da! Ta-da! Voila! Voila! Mula! Voila!

Mama, nana, I'm doing my count
Don't ruin my count, bust two, and I'm out, voila! Magic dust, yeah that's a rush
Got her cracking up, crying all at once, man, that was fun
I'm spazzing up, I'm gassing up that Cali stuff, that massacre
I'm magical with chemicals and smashing stuff, Metallica
Satanical like Skeletor, you greener than a salad bar
I leave from here to Africa to read some Maya Angelou
Impractical, you acting all DiCaprio we trap and go from casserole
We back and forth in traffic with that Macklemore
That magic snow, it's always cold and my freak on that molly water
I met this bitch on Collins but she out the hood, her mama cook
I'm on the way, I'm on a stage, the Magic show, I feel like Dave
I walk on water, float in air, I'm over there, I'm in your face
I pop up out of nowhere, bop-bop at your doorbell
Disappear in thin air, all we leave is smoke there
Smoking roadkill, she on coke here
Stash is sticking to her nosehair
I'm a magician in the motel, moving tricks for wholesale
Hold on, abracadabra, the data don't matter
We rata-ta-ta-ta over the chatter, we got mo ammo than grammar
Hammers and hammers, pull up in Lambos
Shoot up the cameras, die in pajamas
Find you with Sam and your wife and your mamas
All in your family, I'm balling like Magic, voila! Abracadabra, abracadabra!
We rata-ta-ta-ta, then disappeared, right after it happened
Copperfield, I just popped a seal
You don't believe in magic, but you know that I'm for real
Voila! Voila! Ta-da! Ta-da! Voila! Voila! Mula! Voila!
Momma, nana, I'm doing my count
Don't ruin my count, bust two and I'm out

We rata-ta-ta-ta, then disappeared, right after it happened
Copperfield, I just popped a seal
You don't believe in magic, but you know I'm too real
Voila! Voila! OVO shorts, high socks
Music is art, Basquiat, niggas is squares, hopscotch
Time out, na-na, I got sauce, you dried out
I'm big boss, you big mouth, magic show, don't miss out, voila! What haven't I done yet?
I haven't Bungee jumped, err, haven't been to Mount Everest, err, take that back, I've probably have been to Mount Everest. Probably flown over it, probably rolled past it and it just was twisted, you nah mean?  That's real shit, real shit, real shit. Holla at my friends, they will let you know slime has sat down and probably ate with the president, and whatever president it was at the time, totally don't remember, you nah mean? But I do remember, Obama saying my name in a speech, shoutout Obama. But still, what haven't I done yet....release Carter 5None You might think you've peeped the scene
You haven’t; the real one's far too mean
The watered down one, the one you know
Was made up centuries ago
They made it sound all wack and corny
Yes, it's awful—blasted-boring
Twisted fictions, sick addiction
Well, gather 'round, children; zip it; listen Can we get much higher? So high

I fantasized 'bout this back in Chicago
Mercy, mercy me, that Murcielago
That's me, the first year that I blow
How you say broke in Spanish? Me no hablo
Me drown sorrow in that Diablo
Me found bravery in my bravado
DJs need to listen to the models
You ain't got no fuckin' Yeezy in your Serato?
You ain't got no Yeezy, nigga?
Stupid, but what the hell do I know?
I'm just a Chi-town nigga with a Nas flow
And my chick in that new Phoebe Philo
So much head, I woke up to Sleepy Hollow Can we get much higher?
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh Look like a fat booty Celine Dion
Sex is on fire, I'm the King of Leon-a Lewis
Beyond the truest, hey, teacher, teacher
Tell me how do you respond to students?
And refresh the page and restart the memory?
Re-spark the soul and rebuild the energy?
We stopped the ignorance, we killed the enemies
Sorry for the night demons that still visit me
The plan was to drink until the pain over
But what's worse, the pain or the hangover?
Fresh air, rollin' down the window
Too many Urkels on your team, that's why your wins low
Don't make me pull the toys out, huh
Don't make me pull the toys
And fire up the engines, huh
And then they make noise Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh At the mall, there was a seance
Just kids, no parents
Then the sky filled with herons
 in a Chrysler LeBaron
And the hell, it wouldn't spare us
And the fires did declare us
But after that, took pills, kissed an heiress
And woke up back in Paris Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Can we get much higher? So high

Streetsweepers in that Coupé all black

Steel mac, so my kufi never gets smacked
Squeeze a fifth with a grip as I dip
From the paparazzi
Still playing numbers you can't stop me
Still wearing bundles, and spark weed

Them bitches cost 15 dollars
I’m a rich nigga, I take rich drugs
Smoking gas and drinking lean in the strip club
Got too many kids to play with you niggas
I’m lost for words, nothing to say to you niggas
I got a Maybach, a Chevelle, a Drophead
A Wraith, a Audi, Infinity
Got a tour bus that’s long as a fucking centipede
Got a Panamera, a duely and a sling
Cappin’, I’m cappin’, I’m cappin’, I’m cappin’
I put it in your face like a motherfucking napkin
Got me a Sprinter just to play the fucking game in

New York city in the early morning after a night of no electric power. What it did have in the dark streets was a wild outburst of crime. Arson, looting, mugging, and a thousand false fire alarms. At 9:34 last night it all went black I pour some Yac for the days of way back
The turn tables crates of wax turn to major to my earlier days
My world was ablaze, black outs in the summer
No electricity asked out
Breaking down doors, my city was hungry
We vandalized stores, poor
No lights in the project hall
Before the lootin' only 5 DJ crews was movin'
Till people stole DJ equipment the numbers risin'
Now there's friction
First time in Bronx history DJ's poppin' up, there's more mixin'
Everybody wants to be Flash
His name on the flier
The Grandmaster performin' live, no acclaim was higher
He was king and the dream was to be like 'em
Meanwhile C-Cypher's not around
Firehouses shut down
School was closed
Grandmaster  our domes with rules
Written inside the rap scrolls The revolution will not be televised The revolution may not be televised
And we wonderin' who the hell is Koch
This man Koch wanted the mayor's seat
And he's campaignin' like he can't be stopped
Up in the Bronx they forever strong
Don't ever try to play 'em weak
The revolution may not ever be televised
Books command the speech I want to stress first my total outrage that at this hour the city of New York is still without powerSittin in the ferrari, thinkin bout money
I swear i will go head up with all of yall, bumpercar
Bullshit fly by me, im duckin all the bad vibes
Shoot you nine times just in case you got cat lives
Uh, my punch lines give you black eyes
Like, like, gon' kill ya self, seven pounds
I been to hell and back, and made it back fine
Black diamonds killin em, black on black crime
Now can i live and if i can, can i live it up?
Imma squeeze life, just enough to fill tha cup
Well shut the fuck up and steam the purp
Drink it all, im dead
So i throw some ice in it, and belch when i finish, Uh
Excuse me
I heard you got that good, ready for the takeoff
Fire up that wood, at the take, blastoff
To another world, let em see that white moon
Flyin in the sky, tell em we'll be back soon
Uh, its the martian and i come for all
I swear i will go head up with all of yall, bumpercar
Nigga im a slummerdog, millionaire, been there
Smoke some kush and snap my fingers
In case you got cat lives, Uh
So much for bein settled down, suicide flow
Gon' kill ya self, seven pounds
Blunt thick as Bobby Christina, high as Serena's skirt
Only smokin that real grass, no arena turf
Now can i live? and if i can, i rep that dirty south
And you haven't seen cleaner dirt, you haven't seen the worse
So shut the fuck up and steam the purp, tell them haters ?
Yea ive lost my mind, help me find it, i will lead the search, Uhh
I heard you got that good, ready for the takeoff
Fire up that wood, at the take, blastoff
To another world, let em see that white moon
Flyin in the sky, tell em we'll be back soonThe night is young 
Come and go with me 
Up in the sky 
Is where you wanna be
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down Tonight I'm twistin' 'em big, I'm poppin' pink bottles
Pull out the old school chevys and make the pipes rattle
Kev wrap the rubber bands, no credit cards
45 catch the cliques, no bodyguards
Call that my real nigga passport
Pull 'em out when them old bitches ask for it
I've been collecting paper, tryna stuff my bank account
With this pen and paper give you somethin' to think about
The diamonds shine and the wine is muscato
We ride shit from my garage, fuck a limo
My piece is 1 tenth of a dollar
She left her panties at my crib on the coffee table
I'm waitin' for the beat The night is young 
Come and go with me 
Up in the sky 
Is where you wanna be
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down Tonight we're takin' the city and paintin' it all black
Drama on the soundtrack and it's all crack
Your speed exceed 100 down i20
We breathe and smoke in and out and got plenty
I'm on the passenger, tonight I'm lettin' my bitch drive
She here to buckle and the car commitin' suicide
Law enforcement on my car with cameras
Tryna connect gang members and gangsta rappers
Drug dealers, athletes and black actors
Get caught up, prostitutes and back taxes
Fuck it, tonight we're livin' like we don't exist
Time stopped like I broke the watch on my wrist
Somewhere you wanna be? The night is young 
Come and go with me 
Up in the sky 
Is where you wanna be
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down What goes up must come down
And if I stay down, then I don't come up
Life a bitch, I got my hand on the but, foot on the clutch
On my new wonder, smokin' a blunt
Tired of all sililaquez, service squeeze
Still use a triple b for insominity
And please, if bein' broke is your disease
I took a test and passed and nigga I'm clean
Promethazine poured in the 2 liter
Got my gorillas with me, and I'm the zookeeper
See, you ain't seen it all until you've seen it all
If life a movie you never know when it might pause The night is young 
Come and go with me 
Up in the sky 
Is where you wanna be
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down
Honies, cash, weed, cars
Ghetto celebrities and hood movie stars
Gat slingers, now rap singers are who we are
Went from Nasty to Nas to Nas to Escobar The path we all walk starts out long, it's like a boardwalk
Monopoly, some make it around, some go down, it's prophecy
Happy days balancin' with life's atrocities
Hoppin' in V's, knowin' some day I got to lead properly
High up in a five, realizin' the price paid
For this life laid in the light shade
One might say, top of the world's two whips, a crib and a girl
Quick to celebrate it, poppin' corks like they made it
Pretentious, arrogant niggas is senseless
Pro ball players with white wives, peep they night lives
While you could catch me in a crisp white five
Dark tinted, Dijon-scented with Al Green on
My theme song, Love and Happiness, how can it seem wrong?
I mean, before this, I used to rock a Taurus with the donuts
Now, I grown up, got it chromed up
Got the rap game sewn up, sho 'nuff
Niggas actin' cool but it's really no love
I feel a slow buzz off the dutch
This is everyday, every second, got to make it pay
Every lesson I learnt got me open
While most of these rappers'll stay burnt With so much drama in QBC, it's kinda hard bein' Escobarro
El Derado Red, sippin' Dom out the bottle
My life is like a Donald Goines novel, we wave glasses like bravo
Drunk niggas with mad problems and shot pockets
My niggas on the block rock this, box cocaine, cook it and chop it
Lookin' to profit in different ways, goin' through this difficult stage
Called life, but each year my physical's praised
Some fell beyond the reach of help
Cut in the street, thinkin' they could teach theyself
When all we wanted was a piece of wealth
And randomly, feed our family, the streets are insanity
Amply, livin' in this thug's fantasy
Richest nigga in show biz is what I plan to be
Heavy chain and my QB sway, livin' this king's life
Magazines write about me in this dream, it's all tight Now, the main thing that boggle my brain be all the bottles of pain
Ice, the chain and all the followers came
They tried to throw me off track but I caught that
They thought I lost that but I'm continuin' to make more stacks
Halftime, New York State of Mind, It Was Written was hittin'
Trips overseas, southeast, diamond and riches
Sleepin' on the plane, wake up when we land, feelin' real scared
On the ground, Rollie flush, princess cuts and large rounds
The crews up, findin' time to shine rocks
It's real, you violate, be in a pine box
If it go there, I lay you before you lay me, it's crazy
I didn't make the game, the game made me
Records for the babies so they raised up in mansions
Haters keep hatin' and ladies'll keep glancin' Y'all know the routine out this muthafucka, word upAbazaba You know we get in the studio and do what we do best
You know
Beautiful shit
But this time around I wanna do something different homeboy

She say she love it when it sounds like this
She tell me Kendrick put it down like this
When I listen I wanna close my eyes
And feel your lips
Let your lyrics wrap around me and grab my hips
So enticing
On point like the helmet of a Viking
Kicking up dust like I'm hiking
I ain't calling a woman a bitch on this one
I be calling my woman so I could get some
She fresh off work and Lord knows it was hard
She take off her shirt and Lord knows that I'm hard
Composing myself, tryna remain content
She had a long day and plus I know she wanna vent
Now she could talk about her boss and I can give advice
Or she could take the panties off and I could eat the 
Fuck that, option number deuce
On the kitchen table while I play this tune
You know why? This shit my girlfriend'll like

Hahaha yea
This shit my girlfriend'll like
I ain't tryna entertain these other hoes tonight
Aba, this shit my girlfriend'll like my nigga Look 
We be in the car, bumpin' my latest jam
I recorded at the studio around 10 p.m
It's a club banger
Catchy hooks and 808's
I even threw a bridge on it just to play it safe
The first 8 bars, she's lovin' the track
Even rewinding it back
Soon as the beat drop
The way she react she like That's Hot
'Til I start talkin' bout how many hoes I got
How many I fucked
How many I've misled just to get a nut
Like a squirrel, in pursuit of lunch
Uh
Though I'm on some cliché rapper shit
I know she thinking are my lyrics that accurate
She's so cool doe
Don't downplay her just to fuck up the mood yo
She'll still play it even though I sound rude yo
And disregards to the provocative records
One thing that I do know This something my girlfriend'll like

This'll be my girlfriend's joint right here
So I'mma kick the shit she like
It seem right
Like a pair of jeans that fit tight
Around her cute booty
I like to hold her from behind in line
At the movies
Her body language gets read
Like a ruby
Cause she a work-a-art
No help from Julie
I'mma beast and she such a beauty
I love her, she know that, I place no one above her
Far from an arc, but best undercover
Kodak moment every time we in sync
Like a iPod plugged to a USB
It's just you and me
I mean me and her
I mean her and I
It's plain to see, affirmative
So if you ever need me
You know where Herbert is
On her mind
Like she on mine
Uh

And erry one of emOn Macklemore winning best rap album It’s well deserved; he did what he did, man. He went out there and hustled and grinded. Everything happens for a reason; the universe comes back around, that’s how it go. On the Grammys snubbing him entirely I definitely feel like they should always have more of the culture up in there, for sure, because we definitely stand out just like any other genre. We part of the world. We part of the movement. So I think any awards, including the Grammys, should always push for more hip-hop because it’s music as a whole, it’s not just splitting different regions. Everything moves as far as sound and vibrations, and that’s how it goes. And we are a part of that.{ Verse 1: Nate Dogg}
When I met you last night baby. Before you opened up your gap. I had respect for you lady, but now I take it all back. Cause you gave me all your pussy, and you even licked my balls. Leave your number on the cabinet, and I promise baby I'll give you a call. Next time I'm feeling kind of horny. You can come on over, and I'll break you off. And if you can't Fuck that say baby, just lay back and open your mouth. Cause I have never met a girl. That I love in the whole wide world { Verse 2: Kurupt}
Well If Kurupt gave a Fuck about a bitch, I'de always be broke. I never have no MuthaFuckin endo the smoke, I gets loc'ed and loony bitch you can't do me. Do we look like BBD, you hoochie groupie. I have no love for ho's. That's something I learned in the pound, so how the Fuck am I suppose to pay this ho, just to lay this ho. I know the pussy's mines, Imma Fuck a couple more times. And then I'm through with it. There's nothing else to do with it. Pass it to the homie, now you hit it. Cause she ain't nothing but a bitch to me, and ya'll know that bitches ain't shit to me. I gives a Fuck. Why don't ya'll pay attention, approach her with a different proposition. I'm Kurupt ho, you'll never be my only one { Hook }
It Ain't No Fun, If the homies can't have none { Verse 3: Snoop Dogg}
Guess who's back in the MuthaFuckin house, with a fat dick for your MuthaFuckin mouth. Ho's recognize, niggas do to cause when bitches get scandalous and pull a voodoo. What you gon' do? You really don't know, so I'd advised you not to trust that ho. Silly of me to fall in love with a bitch. Knowing damn well I'm too caught up with my grip, now as the sun rotates and my game grow ups bigger. How many bitches wanna Fuck this nigga named Snoop Doggy I'm all the above I'm too swift on my toe's to get caught up with you ho's. But see It's ain't no fun, I'm my homies can't get a taste of it, cause you know I don't love it { Verse 4: Warren G}
See Kurupt don't give a Fuck, Snoop don't give a Fuck so guess I'll just say that I don't give a Fuck. Because bitches ain't shit, but they seem kind of funny when you getting to the rap game and you making money. But back up bitch because I'm struggling, just get on your knees and then start juggling. These MuthaFuckin nuts in your mouth. It's me Warren G the nigga with the clout

We invite you to somethin' epic, you know?
Well, we hustle out of a sense of hopelessness
Sort of a desperation
Through that desperation, we become addicted
Sort of like the fiends we accustomed to servin'
But we feel we have nothin' to lose
So, we offer you, well, we offer our lives, right?
What do you bring to the table? While I'm watchin' every nigga watchin' me closely
My shit is butter for the bread, they wanna toast me
I keep my head, both of them, where they supposed to be
Hoes'll get you sidetracked, then clapped from close feet
I don't sleep, I'm tired, I feel wired like codeine, these days
A brother gotta admire me from four fiends away
My pain, wish it was quick to see
From sellin' 'caine 'til brains was fried to a fricassee
Can't lie, at the time it never bothered me
At the bar, gettin' my thug on properly
My squad and me lack of respect for authority
Laughin' hard, happy to be escapin' poverty, however brief
I know this game got valleys and peaks
Expectation for dips, for precipitation we stack chips, hardly
The youth I used to be, soon to see a mill'in
No more Big Willie, my game has grown
Prefer you call me William
Illin' for revenues, Rayful Edmond-like
Channel 7 News, round seven jewels, head dead in the mic
Forgettin' all I ever knew, convenient amnesia
I suggest you call my lawyer, I know the procedure.
Lock my body, can't trap my mind
Easily explain why we adapt to crime
I'd rather die enormous than live dormant, that's how we on it
Live at the main event, I bet a trip to Maui on it
Presidential suites my residential for the weekend
Confidentially speakin' in codes since I sense you peekin'
The NSX rental, don't be fooled, my game is mental
We both out of town, dog, what you tryin' to get into?
Viva Las Vegas, see ya later at the crap tables
Meet me by the one that starts a G up
This way no Fraud Willies present gamblin' they re-up
And we can have a pleasant time, sippin' margaritas Ge-ge-geyeahhh
Can I live?
Can I live? My mind is infested with sick thoughts that circle
Like a Lexus, if driven wrong it's sure to hurt you
Dual level like duplexes, in unity
My crew and me commit atrocities like we got immunity
You guessed it, manifest it
In tangible goods, platinum Rolex'd it
We don't lease, we buy the whole car, as you should
My confederation, dead a nation
Explode on detonation, overload the mind of a said patient
When it boils to steam, it comes to it
We all fiends, gotta do it: even righteous minds go through this
True this, the streets school us to spend our money foolish
Bond with jewelers and watch for intruders
I stepped it up another level, meditated like a Buddhist
Recruited lieutenants with ludicrous dreams of gettin' cream
Let's do this, it gets tedious
So I keep one eye open like CBS — you see me stressed, right? Can I live?
Can I live?
Can I live?
Can I live?

Roc Nation it takes a nation to stop
I'm signing off, it's the hood's Barack, BRRRACK! Motherfucker I'm ill!
Motherfucker I'm illHttp://www.schaulager.org/smq/files/lynching_tree.jpg This performance features a clear example of using symbolism to enrich the message of the song Blood on the Leaves tells the story of a relationship torn apart by materialism, unprotected sex, and drugs. West samples Nina Simone's rendition of 'Strange Fruit', a song that paints a vivid picture of racial violence in the segregated South. West samples the line: Black bodies swinging from the summer breeze; strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees. The frenzied, pitched up use of this line cast the song in a racial light. The characters in 'Blood on the Leaves' become the lynched victims in 'Strange Fruit'. Instead of racial violence, these characters have fallen victim to the perils of materialism, drugs and unprotected sex, all of which are issues that disproportionately affect the black community West performed this song,already saturated with meaning, at the VMA awards in front of a purposefully lighted and positioned backdrop of a photo by film director Steven McQueen. The photo depicts a tree in New Orleans that was the site of racially charged lynchings. It’s lit and positioned in such a way that as West performs in front of it, he appears as a shadow, his erratic movements almost resembling a man hanging from the branches. The shadows of the audience’s raised hands appear at the bottom of the frame, as if coming out of the ground, representing the scores of victims buried at sites like this across America Http://divaartist.com/divablog/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Screenshot_2013-08-26-00-20-13_1.jpg After the performance West posted a picture of the tree captioned: those who were murdered are buried in the ground around the tree. Https://s3.amazonaws.com/rapgenius/1377548967_JKYK1ZZ.jpg This nuanced imagery, rife with symbolism, paints a powerful and disturbing scene that adds potency to West’s message of the relics of slavery in today's society
Uhh..
Uh.. speak without thinkin'..
Speak without speakin'.. huh..
Feel without reachin', uhh
That's what it's about
It's about that, inner, inner love, yaknahmean? God love us hood niggas

And he who has sight, let him see
He who has life, let him be
See everything goes through change
Those who know don't talk
And those who talk don't know a thing
Men are born soft and turn tough
Dead lay a stiffened heart, I've been kissed by God
I've been hurt, I've been marked for death, almost ripped apart
By the beast but he missed his mark
Alone in the dark my thoughts had sparked up
When I saw my body on the floor, from above I watch it all
Yo it came to me, the pain in me
Many slain empty skulls where a brain should be
It strangely seemed, like it was a dream
But the si-rens had never woke me
Only reason I'm here now is 'cause God chose me
And to me, I'm only just a crook nigga
But God love us hood niggas God love us hood niggas 
'Cause next to Jesus on the cross was the crook niggas 
And the killers, God love us good niggas

'Cause he be with us in the prisons
And he takes time to listen, uhh
God love us hood niggas 
'Cause next to Jesus on the cross was the crook niggas, uhh
But he forgive us Day by day by day I sit back and pray
My thugs get packed away, in a maxi-cage
They pass away, they went off the casket way
My gats will spray, but that won't bring 'em back today
So long my crimes now gone for eternity
The team we got left on the set, now turn to me
Can't speak, tears in my eyes, revenge in my mind
I ride past the church where they got his body and find
They takin' him to the hearse to put his body in dirt
That's it, pay my respects, wipe my tears with my shirt
Now it's time to do work, out of love and retribution
As loyalty, he would die for me, no excuses
Loadin' clips up, countin' bullets carefully
For self, though it feels like, he was there for me
Saw the enemy, I ate him, saw Jakes behind me
They ain't knock me, it's obvious that God's watchin' me God love us hood niggas 
'Cause next to Jesus on the cross was the crook niggas 
And the killers, God love us good niggas

And he takes time to listen, uhh
God love us hood niggas 
'Cause next to Jesus on the cross was the crook niggas, uhh
But he forgive us Jealousy in the hood, felonies in the hood
Thugs with guns become celebrities in the hood
Yo it's beef in the hood, smoke trees in the hood
Little girls have seeds by OGs in the hood
It's food in the hood, it's drugs in the hood
You can choose if you would, coke to sniff
Dope to ooze in your blood, parolees
Ex-cons live in the hood, it's jobs in the hood
You can starve in the hood
Your best friends'll fuck your baby moms in the hood
But it's good in the hood, I was raised in the hood
Was taught how to walk and duck strays in the hood
I stays in the hood, got my ways from the hood
Learned to play ball go to the NBA, in the hood
There's AIDS 
Our lives are the worst, on top of that, we broke
That's the main reason why God, love us the most God love us hood niggas 
'Cause next to Jesus on the cross was the crook niggas 
And the killers, God love us good niggas

I'm a pimp in every sense of the word
Bitch, better trust and believe 'em
In the cut where I keep 'em
'Til I need a nut, 'til I need to beat the guts
Then it's beep beep and I'm pickin' them up
Let 'em play with the dick in the truck
Many chicks wanna put Jigga's fists in cuffs
Divorce him and split his bucks
Just because you got good head
I'ma break bread, so you can be livin' it up?
Shit, I part with nothin', y'all be frontin'
Me give my heart to a woman?
Not for nothin', never happen; I'll be forever mackin'
Heart cold as assassins, I got no passion
I got no patience and I hate waitin'
Ho, get your ass in and let's ride! We doin' big pimpin', we spendin' cheese
Check 'em out now, big pimpin' on B.L.A.D.'s
We doin' big pimpin' up in N.Y.C
It's just that Jigga Man, Pimp C, and B-U-N B Nigga, it's the big Southern rap impresario
Comin' straight up out the black barrio
Makes a mill' up off a sorry ho
Then sit back and peep my sce-nahr-i-o
Oops, my bad, that's my scenario
No, I can't fuck a scary ho
Now every time, every place, everywhere we go
Hoes start pointin', they say: There he go!
Now these motherfuckers know we carry mo'
Heat than a little bit
We don't pull it out over little shit
And if you catch a lick when I spit
Then it won't be a little hit
Go read a book, you illiterate son of a bitch!
And step up your vocab!
Don't be surprised if your ho stab out with me
And you see us comin' down on yo' SLAB
Livin' ghetto-fabulous, so mad, you just can't take it
But nigga if you hatin' I
Then you wait while I get your bitch butt-naked
Just break it; you gotta pay like you weigh
Wet with two pairs of clothes on
Now get yo' ass to the back as I'm flyin' to the track
Timbaland, let me spit my prose on
Pump it up in the pro-zone
That's the track that we breakin' these hoes on
Ain't the track that we flows on
But when shit get hot then the Glock start poppin' like ozone
We keep hoes crunk like Trigger-man
For real, it don't get no bigger, man
Don't trip, let's flip, gettin' throwed on the flip
Gettin' blowed with the motherfuckin' Jigga Man, fool! We be big pimpin', spendin' cheese
We be big pimpin' on B.L.A.D.'s
We be big pimpin' down in P.A.T
It's just that Jigga Man, Pimp C, and B-U-N B Smokin' out, pourin' up
Keepin' lean up in my cup
All my car got leather and wood
In my hood we call it buck
Everybody wanna ball
Holla at broads at the mall
If he up, watch him fall
Nigga, I can't fuck with y'all
If I wasn't rappin', baby
I would still be ridin' Mercedes
Comin' down and sippin' daily
No record 'til whitey pay me
Uhhh, now what y'all know about them Texas boys?
Comin' down in candied toys
Smokin' weed and talkin' noise We be big pimpin', spendin' cheese
We be big pimpin' on B.L.A.D.'s
We be big pimpin' down in P.A.T
It's just that Jigga Man, Pimp C, and B-U-N B On the canopy, my stamina be
Enough for Pamela Anderson Lee
MTV jam of the week
Made my money quick, then back to the streets
But still sittin' on blades, sippin' that Ray
Standin' on the corner of my block, hustlin'
Still gettin' that cane
Half what I paid slippin' right through customs
It'll sell by night, its egg shell white
I got so many grams, if the man find out
It will land me in jail for life
But I'm still big pimpin', spendin' cheese
With Bun B, Pimp C, and Timothy
We got bitches in the back of the truck
Laughin' it up, Jigga Man: that's what's up! We be big pimpin', spendin' cheese
We be big pimpin' on B.L.A.D.'s
We be big pimpin' down in P.A.T
It's just that Jigga Man, Pimp C, and B-U-N B I keep it fresher than the next bitch
No need..for you to ever sweat the next bitch

And papayas, from the village to the tele

Fuck them Reebok broads, you made it known who your wife was

Ho, yeah, uh huh
It's Trey Songz and uh, D-R-A-K-K-E
Ahahaha, the boys of summer are here man
Ayo Trey, I got something mean for this one boy Chances are most of the days you was lying around
I made money thats why these girls eyeing me down
By nineteen I might seem destined for millions
Promoters on my ass so I'm guessing they filled in
I take cues from my big boy Popz
I'm the only young dude that the big boys watch
They getting foul on the star
But it's all eyes on me like I'm copying some vows for the bar
Get it?
Guess not
Picture me not strive
To land in the top ten slip in the top five
Same thing in the top four trust I'm hot boy
Maybe even the top three Trey you got me?
Nowadays I peak they interests
Especially when life's bringing them pain and lately they been stressed
Money making brothers should take notes
See broke niggas is the problem and us is the scape goat
Somebody get the waiter
They need a second plate a this knowledge
If you ain't got it you could catch it later
My money and love is separate before I commit to date her
I put a split in the middle and learn to separate her It ain't about the rims on my truck
Ain't about the ice on my watch
Ain't about the coupe or my truck
Baby it's about the game Ridin' low
Layed back in the seat when I creep
That's just how I roll
With some fresh nice ones on my feet
Girl that's how it goes
And I'm tryin' to find a chick I can meet who ain't 'bout the dough
Cause it ain't all about that no more When you ask why I hustle in the streets that's just who I be
Yo I live for the dough, for the flow, for feelin' free
Ain't too many other dudes you can choose to get this luxury
But without it all I'm still about the game The haters wanna hate, but it ain't no thing no
Because the ladies choose to love me  It ain't about the shoes that I've got
Ain't about my dough or my rocks
Ain't the life I live, it don't stop
Baby it's about the game Uhm, blacka blacka
Lose a backer, you should back up
Blucka blucka, you should suffer
Lose a mother, motherfucker your mother
Fuck your brother, that fucker died like John Tucker
I'm ruckus, I'm ill, no for real
I'm the only stingray in the water that kills
A bad pill, y'all sweeter than Advils
While I sit on your girl bread like her last meal
I blew up before I grew up
Got introduced to the game, now I'm at they heads like crew cuts
Suit up and lace your boots up
It's war time
It's Weezy Baby, no crime, no lyin'
Y'all motherfuckers slipping, you better hold on
I think they tripping like Cedric and Solange
I flow like I'm headless, no mind
I can say don't rhyme and it's gonna rhyme
Drought
Geah, yeah
Life is but a dream to me, I don't wanna wake up
Thirty odd years without having my cake up
So I'm about my paper 24/7, 365, 366 in a leap year
I don't know why we here
Since we gotta be here life is but a beach ch-ch-ch-chair
Went from having shabby clothes, crossing over Abbey Road
Hear my angels singing to me 
I just hope I'm hearing right; karma's got me fearing life
Colleek, are you praying for me?
See I got demons in my past, so I got daughters on the way
If the prophecy's correct, then the child should have to pay
For the sins of a father, so I barter my tomorrows against my yesterdays
In hopes that she'll be okay
And when I'm no longer here to shade her face from the glare
I'll give her my share of Carol's Daughter and a new beach chair I hear my angels sing...
Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna wake up, wake up

Life is but a dream and you really don't wanna leave

Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna wake up, wake up

Life is but a dream and you really don't wanna leave Life is but a dream to me
Gun shots sing to these other guys
But lullabies don't mean a thing to me
I'm not afraid of dying, I'm afraid of not trying
Every day hit every wave like I'm Hawaiian
I don't surf the net, no, I never been on MySpace
Too busy letting my voice vibrate
Carving out my space in this world of fly girls
Cut-throats and diamond-cut ropes I twirls
Benzes round corners where the sun don't shine
I let the wheels give a glimpse of hope of one's grind
Some said: Hov', how you get so fly?
I said: From not being afraid to fall out the sky
My physical's a shell so when I say farewell
My soul will find an even higher plane to dwell
So have no fear, just know that
Life is but a beach chair I hear my angels sing...
Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna wake up, wake up

Life is but a dream and you really don't wanna leave
Life is but a dream

Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna wake up, wake up

Life is but a dream and you really don't wanna leave
Life is but a dream Life is but a dream
Can't mimic my life, I'm the thinnest cut slice
Intercut, the winner's cup
With winters rough enough to interrupt life
That's why I'm both saint and sinner, nice
This is Jay everyday, no compromise
No compass comes with this life just eyes
So to map it out you must look inside
Sure books can guide you but your heart defines you, chica
Your corazón is what brought us home
In great shape like Heidi Klum, Maricón, I am on
Permanent vacay, life is but a beach chair
This song is like a Hallmark card until you reach here
So 'til she's here, and she's declared
The heir, I will prepare
A blueprint for you to print
A map for you to get back
A guide for your eyes, and so you won't lose scent
I'll make a stink for you to think
I ink these verses full of prose
So you won't get conned out of two cent
My last will and testament I leave my heir
My share of Roc-A-Fella Records and a shiny new beach chair I hear my angels sing...
Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna wake up, wake up

Life is but a dream and you really don't wanna leave
Life is but a dream

Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna wake up, wake up

Life is but a dream and you really don't wanna leave
Life is but a dream
I hear my angels sing...
Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna wake up, wake up

Life is but a dream and you really don't wanna leave
Life is but a dream

Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna wake up, wake up

Life is but a dream and you really don't wanna leave
Life is but a dream I hear my angels sing
I hear my angels sing
I hear my angels sing

You can save your bullshit on your memory card
If this real nigga business, then you niggas unemployed
Jumped on the celly, called Makaveli
He say he was gravy, I say I was jelly
Looked in the mirror, said You's an ill nigga
Then I ran to the money like track and field nigga
Now I think I'll have me a coffee with six sugars
In a world full of ass-kissers and dick pullers
I'm tryna walk a straight line but the line crooked
I'm shooting for the stars, astronauts dodge bullets
Yeah, I bought a brand new attitude
The hate is music to my ears, I got my dancin' shoes
Sometimes we question shit that there is no answer to

And when life sucks, I just enjoy the head
I'm so sick of these niggas, I need meds
Uh, smoking on that hallelujah, thank you Jesus
Help me focus on the future and not the previous
Double R, I'm a rebel with a reason
Sometimes you gotta fight the devil with a demon
Blood is in the streets and it is up to my knees
Underground shit, I see myself as a seed
Living in the glass, and everybody's looking
But how can you get the picture if you don't know who took it?
This current affairs, but who the hell cares?
Everybody's fighting over positions, musical chairs
On the road to redemption, you gonna use a few spares
I'm just fucking ready so I come prepared Yeah I know your name  yeah
Your name is unimportant, yeah 
We in the belly of the beast, yeah
And she thinking 'bout abortion, damn And the rockets red glare, the bombs bursting in air
Life is a rollercoaster, but still unfair
A blessing in disguise is right before our eyes
But since it is in disguise, we don't know that it's there And I, see you with your palms in your pants
But me, me, see me, I got the world in my hands
I make it spin on my finger, I'm a critical thinker

Matter of fact, you should take four b
Think before you fuck with real killas in the street For my niggas that hate the fights

Quickly push back your dome like a hot comb
So swiftly, come get me
If I had every bitch in the world, boy, you still ain't fuckin' with me
I'm 'bout my money strictly, as long as I stack my banks up
I'll have enough Young Bucks to fuck with 50
Now who fuckin' with me? Me and that gun was born siamese twins
So where I move, it's comin' with me
You down right, play with me, think I won't take your life
The scope'll have more dots on you than a website
I'm 'bout my head right and yours left
I swear in the vocal booth is where I'll take my last breath
That's K-Dot, oh you ain't heard? Shit, that boy hot
With dime bitches runnin' on beaches like baywatch
You sit and watch the young child with my money stacks
Add up faster than cell phones on speed dial For my niggas that hate the fights
Get it with the Glocks
Get it with the Glocks
Get it with the Glocks
For my niggas that hustle nights
Bakin' with the pots
Bakin' with the pots

Jumpin' in a Hennessy bottle 
Told her if she suck me, then swallow 
New .45 filled with hollows 
Put her man right after sorrow

Bad trips like, Yah!
Nazareth, I'm fucked up
Homie, you fucked up
But if God got us, then we gon' be alright Nigga, we gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Huh? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright Uh, and when I wake up
I recognize you're looking at me for the pay cut
But homicide be looking at you from the face down
What MAC-11 even boom with the bass down?
Schemin', and let me tell you 'bout my life
Painkillers only put me in the twilight
Where pretty pussy and Benjamin is the highlight
Now tell my momma I love her, but this what I like, Lord knows
Twenty of 'em in my Chevy, tell 'em all to come and get me
Reaping everything I sow, so my karma comin' heavy
No preliminary hearings on my record
I'm a motherfucking gangster in silence for the record, uh
Tell the world I know it's too late
Boys and girls, I think I gone cray
Drown inside my vices all day
Won't you please believe when I say Wouldn't you know
We been hurt, been down before
Nigga, when our pride was low
Lookin' at the world like, Where do we go?
Nigga, and we hate po-po
Wanna kill us dead in the street fo sho'
Nigga, I'm at the preacher's door
My knees gettin' weak, and my gun might blow
But we gon' be alright Nigga, we gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Huh? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright What you want you? A house or a car?
Forty acres and a mule? A piano, a guitar?
Anything, see my name is Lucy, I'm your dog
Motherfucker, you can live at the mall
I can see the evil, I can tell it, I know it's illegal
I don't think about it, I deposit every other zero
Thinking of my partner, put the candy, paint it on the Regal
Digging in my pocket, ain't a profit big enough to feed you
Every day my logic get another dollar just to keep you
In the presence of your chico... Ah!
I don't talk about it, be about it, every day I sequel
If I got it then you know you got it, Heaven, I can reach you
Pat Dawg, Pat Dawg, Pat Dawg, my dog, that's all
Bick back and Chad, I trap the bag for y'all
I rap, I black on track so rest assured
My rights, my wrongs; I write 'til I'm right with God Wouldn't you know
We been hurt, been down before
Nigga, when our pride was low
Lookin' at the world like, Where do we go?
Nigga, and we hate po-po
Wanna kill us dead in the street fo sho'
Nigga, I'm at the preacher's door
My knees gettin' weak, and my gun might blow
But we gon' be alright Nigga, we gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Huh? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright I keep my head up high
I cross my heart and hope to die
Lovin' me is complicated
Too afraid of a lot of changes
I'm alright, and you're a favorite
Dark nights in my prayers I remembered you was conflicted
Misusing your influence, sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power, full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screamin' in the hotel room
I didn't wanna self-destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went runnin' for answersBet my niggaWhat the hell...what the hell...
Check check check check it out
What the hell...what the hell... People know me on these streets player, I ain't new
Lookin at me all funny, while I'm countin my money
Suprise, what I do is already legalized
Analyze what I toss across, ain't no love lost Fo' sure, everythings for dough now
Flow, you gotta pay a little more now
It's platinum, now a days we put the gold down
We stepped it up, y'all don't ever want a showdown
Get wetted up by the sleeve that leave the bezel out
Y'all don't like it? Sue me, fuck I'll settle out
Ghetto'd out in the vehicle Bent
These days I mellowed out, see success make a fella content
Uh-huh, you know, this rap star, Papi Chulo
Jay-Z, Hugo, of course player you lost player
I know you rappers wanna see me fail
But quick to see a 600SEL V-12
Live wit it, y'all got dough to get get it
I got mine, your little bit of money couldn't stop mine
Your block time, too hot, too many hands in your pie
Seventy thirty, the nigga you work for work for me
Bottom line People know me on these streets and the towns I been through
Lookin at me, stay focused, I'm givin em straight poker suprise
What I do is already legalized
Analyze how I floss of course, ain't no love lost We be the Bronx to BK'lyn, togethor we about a ton or better
On the way in, we rhyme related, very underestimated
That's why I'm winnin in this world of sins
Steady grinnin, money boss spendin
Distant from dirty women, Lord, I'm quite influencial
Spiritualy and mental, what you into I done been through
Preachin my words and don't know what you owe
It shows you wanna be me, but won't show it
Ain't nothin changed, but players, the game remains the same
I had a ten year run, hey I can't complain
Took the next step see, from Coke to Pepsi
From the bx weed, ridin the south beach on jet-ski
Play to survive, you ain't live you just livin
You breathin a good one, but where I'm from, y'all forbidden
Come around, bad decision, you rather be in prison
Ain't' no duckin what I'm deliverin won't be forgivin in
Layin there shiverin, half the night
You gotta walk toward the light, everything is aiight
I make sure everything you endure stays tight
Big  Lord Tariq, Jay-Z, outta sight I spend nights on corners, see the crack, cop my first Mac
No longer scared to pump what y'all pump, now I burst back
It hurts that, don't seem C.R.E.A.M can make my purse fat
Without the benefits of a doubt, I hit the hearst black
But curse that, tryin to see Nas was your worst match
Blowin like Tahitii, throw off NYPD
Am I greedy? Like Amin Idi see me
In a fly Salinii gimme frames and the beanie
I flip my loot twice a week on the most trifest streets
You got no right to eat by the laws of life you keep
Ain't no love lost, none taken, none givin'
Stressin how I'm livin it, thinkin when my loot first came
Look what I did with it, bought my click glaciers
And pagers, rollin ten deep to Las Vegas
Copped a live croc, chopped it up, hit my block off
Wit gators, feedin peoples, from the bridge to Dequatas
But now, two years five months and 30 days later
I still put out the street flavor
But watch that kid right there, a bulge in his night wear
Awoke me up the ways I used to be in my heist years
Bubble eye small fry loaded four five
Just thirstin for some person with shine to just walk by
Now that I can see the 360, now that its me thats jiggy
Them cooly heads they wanna stick me, whoa
I remove your roof nigga let the sun shine in
Thirty-eight waist, enough to put one nine in
Really a thirty-six without the gun I'm thin
But when the gat is tucked, I'm fat as fuck
Ignorant bastard, I'm takin' it back to day one
No kids, but trust me I know how to raise a gun
For niggas that think I spend my days in the sun
Well here's the shock of your life, the Glock not the mic
Homie I'm not into hype; trust me, I'm still street
You still fuckin' up then trust me I still creep
Yeah I know the platinum chain be lookin' real sweet
But reach and I bury niggas sixty feet deep
S dot Carter turn rappers into martyrs
Separate fathers from their daughters, why bother
I'm a crook like you, I took like you
I disobeyed the law, threw out the book like you
How dare you look at Jigga like I'm shook like who
I keep the fifth with me nigga, come and get me.. COME AND GET ME!
{*gong sounds*} Ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-come..
{*bell rings*} COME AND GET ME! Ka-ka-ka-COME AND GET ME! ..
{*bell rings*} COME AND GET ME! Ka-ka-ka..
{*bell rings*} .. Ka-ka-ka-ka-come
{*bell rings*} .. come and get me COME AND GET ME Don't know what y'all niggas is
Tryin' to do but I don't like it
Yeah, straight gangster shit
Heyyyy, uh-huh-uh-uhh gangster shit
Uhh, straight gangster nigga
Roc.. Yo, the summer's 'bout to get hot
Niggas home from jail and they plottin'
Heard about the watch, the Bentley hard-top
The Continental T, got 'em resentin' me
God I work hard, please don't envy me
I paid the cost to be the boss to floss this hard
I can recall a year ago I almost lost this job
All y'all remember is the part about me parkin' the hard
What about all them days I was walkin' my dogs
Barkin' at broads, but they never hollered back
And if they did all they said was, Where them dollars at?
Imagine, bein' skinny growin' up around brolic cats
The quiet assassin demeanor of them college cats
Until I got a gat and loudly start poppin' back
Round the way, niggas called me Bobby Boucher
Now all I hear is whispers of what you gon' do to Jay
How y'all gon' stick me up, take my jewels away
Pull out your gat, car jack me, take my cruise away
Well I got news for y'all fools today, hey.. I got, shots to give, come and get me nigga
Y'all wanna rob the kid? Come and get me nigga
I won't, part with this, come and get me nigga
I worked, hard for this, come and get me nigga
I got, shots to give, COME AND GET ME...
COME AND GET ME... I made it so, you could say Marcy and it was all good
I ain't crossover I brought the suburbs to the hood
Made 'em relate to your struggle, told 'em 'bout your hustle
Went on MTV with do-rags, I made them love you
You know normally them people wouldn't be fuckin' witchu
'Til I made 'em understand why you do what you do
I expected to hear, Jay, if it wasn't for you..
But instead, all I hear is buzzin' in your crew
How y'all schemin', tryin' to get accustomed to my moves
So y'all could tape my mouth, stake out my house
But I got pride I'm a nigga first
I gotta cock back and pull the trigger first
That's how Jigga work
The funny thing; I represent y'all every time I spit a verse
And that's the shit that hurts
But hey, I got my mind right, got my nine right here
So when y'all feel that the time is right.. I got, shots to give, come and get me nigga
Y'all wanna rob the kid? Come and get me nigga
I won't, part with this, come and get me nigga
I worked, hard for this, come and get me nigga
I got, shots to give, COME AND GET ME...
COME AND GET ME... Ayo yo, ayo yo
It's only fair that I warn ya, rap's my new hustle
I'm treatin' it like the corner, fuck with me if you wanna
My game change but my mind-frame remains the same
I gotta protect what's mine
Shit I started from nothin'; zero, zip
I made my way hustlin', I don't owe niggas shit
I'm paranoid now, so I keep the gun gripped
Cats I played skelly with? Niggas done flipped
I keep a banger in the ankle, one in the hip
Two in the stash, one come up when I shift
I keep one under the chair where I sit
I even got a gun in the hair in the bun of my bitch
Ask Biggs; every time he'd come to my crib
He'd find another gun that I hid
I'm ready to make this one of the, hottest summer there is
Everyday like a hundred-and-six... shit... I got, shots to give, come and get me nigga
Y'all wanna rob the kid? Come and get me nigga
I won't, part with this, come and get me nigga
I worked, hard for this, come and get me nigga
I got, shots to give, COME AND GET ME...
COME AND GET ME... I got, shots to give, come and get me nigga
Y'all wanna rob the kid? Come and get me nigga
I won't, part with this, come and get me nigga
I worked, hard for this, come and get me nigga
I got, shots to give, COME AND GET ME...

So amazing, so amazing, so amazing, it's amazing
So amazing, so amazing, so amazing, it's amazing Now everybody serenade the new faith of Kendrick Lamar
This is King Kendrick Lamar
King Kendrick and I meant it, my point intended is raw
Fix your lenses forensics would've told you Kendrick had killed it
Pretend it's a massacre and the masses upon us
And I mastered being the master at dodging your honor
And the chapter that read at 25 I would live dormant like five in the morning
They raid your spot while Kendrick's performing
And if they take everything, know I got Compton, Compton, ain't no city quite like mine Ay, Dre what's happening wit' it my nigga
Still I'm at it, peel the plastic off it, you can feel the magic
Still I'm laughing at the critics talking, I can see 'em gagging
When I'm back in the back of my city, back in the 'bach
With a batch of them banging Dre Beats with me, look where I'm at
It's the murder cap' and I'm captain at birthing this gangsta rap
It's a wrap when I'm done and I come a long way from a hundred dollars a month
To a hundred mil' in a day, bitch I'm from Compton, Compton, ain't no city quite like mine So come and visit the tire screeching, ambulance, policeman
Won't you spend a weekend on Rosecrans nigga
Khaki creasing, crime increasing on Rosecrans nigga
Kendrick Conan nigga
Where you sword at, hand on the cross and swore that
I do it big as Rasputia for them shooters
Kama Sutra scream fuck your position and make you hold that
I'm trying to stay grounded like four flats
But I know flats and Piru Crip tats Will swarm on me like a beehive
Hop in the G ride
From the West to the East side
Know that's just how Compton roll And that's a given
I pass the blunt then pass the torch of course that's my decision
I crash the Porsche then you report that you see me in Benzes
I must report that we import the narcotics you bought it
Then talked about it when crack hit the speakers, the music business
I blow up every time we throw up a record
Depending on what you expecting, I'm sure it's bigger than your religion
Perfected by niggas that manifested music to live in Compton, Compton, ain't no city quite like mine So tell that gangster throw his set high
Roll it up in a blunt, I'mma take you on the next high
I did exactly what I wanted that's what made them checks fly
In my direction, you never questioned when I said I
Would be a mogul before I visit 2Pac and Left-eye
Eazy and Aaliyah when I see you we gon' test drive
A Lambo in heaven but for now I'm on the redeye
Flying back to my city cuz I'll forever standby Compton, Compton, ain't no city quite like mine Now we can all celebrate
We can all harvest the rap artists of NWA
America target our rap market, as controversy and hate
Harsh realities we in made our music translate
To the coke dealers, the hood rich
And the broke niggas that play
With them gorillas that know killers
That know where you stay
Roll that kush, crack that case, ten bottles of rosé
This was brought to you by Dre
Now every motherfucker in here say:
Look who's responsible
For taking Compton international
I make 'em holla Ayo Just Blaze, good looking homie
Just Blaze
Ain't no city quite like mine, yeah
In the city of Compton
Ain't no city quite like mine Mom, I finna use the van real quick!
Be back, 15 minutes! My rhyme style real nonchalant
Trust me rude boy ain't what you want
Hit your ass up have you doing somersaults
Then I drop your trashy ass off in the garbage
Every week I get my car washed
This is the life of a hustler this is not facade
And what you looking at is not a mirage
You probably see me at the W having a Menage
Performing
Slap a little ass recording
Im doing 160 for my niggas in Porsches
They say I'm speeding cause im on that far left side
I'm from the south but im smoking on that west side
Im in my best ride
I let my girl wash clothes on the G4 so I can let the jet dry
I'm the best I know this
And you ain't even notice
Until I rode up on you in a Lotus
Brushing dust off my shoulders
Like fuck it im focused
Im fucking with bitches thats only fucking with soldiers
Now listen
I got a old school the color of Okra
The tires as wide as Oprah
Watching it when its approaching
Now listen
Peace up
A-Town down
You know I got that piece up so I won't play around
Got a extra round
Plus I got a clip on it
Pollute your block

For the kids man, it's for the kids man!
It's for the kids, hold on hold, back up {*fades out*}Psychologists have said it takes 21 days to make or break a habit. On the 22nd day, you’ve found the way. On December 3rd, one day before my 44th birthday I will embark on a 22 Days challenge to go completely vegan, or as I prefer to call it, plant-based!! This all began a few months back when a good friend and vegan challenged me to embrace a “plant-based breakfast” everyday. It was surprisingly easier on me than I thought… Why now? There’s something spiritual to me about it being my 44th birthday and the serendipity behind the number of days in this challenge; 22  coupled with the fact that the challenge ends on Christmas day…It just feels right! So you can call it a spiritual and physical cleanse. I will post my progress… Any professional vegans out there that have any great food spots please help out! Please ha. I don’t know what happens after Christmas. A semi-vegan, a full plant-based diet? Or just a spiritual and physical challenge? We’ll see… Best of luck and health! P.S. B is also joining me. I will let my friend Marco explain the benefits of a plant based diet here. + 
Yeah!

Chain snatchin', ain't have it, gotta get it

Aw, man—I'm Jackie Robinson
'Cept when I run base, I dodge the pen
Lucky me, luckily, they didn't get me
Now when I bring the Nets, I'm the Black Branch Rickey
From Brooklyn corners, burnin' branches of sticky
Spread love, Biggie; Brooklyn, hippie
I pity the fool with jewels like Mr. T
With no history in my borough, they borrow
With no intentions of returnin' tomorrow
The sun don't come out for many, like Annie
Half-orphan, Mama never had an abortion
Papa sort of did; still, I managed to live
I go hard, I owe it all to the crib
Now please tell me, what the fuck's harder than this? Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard

Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard  While I'm doin' my time due to circumstance
Cross that bridge, face the consequence
Once bid ten, now I paid my dues
Risk takers, we break the rules
Get so dark, but I see good
Bed-Stuy stay high in my neck of the woods
Now, let it ring out, it's a warnin'
 Let it be sworn in
Gotta make it stick workin' like we blue collar
Rip it to the core, underneath it all we harder
Right into the clip, bring it to the floor
One step, one step, give it up more
The road is rough and the street's a mess
Got big cash dreams and a sick death wish
Robbin' out the commercial stash
Kill the voice screamin' in my head Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard

Where them bitches shaking that ass, deuce deuce in they bras
Where them niggas rockin' the flash, drinkin' liquor that’s hard
Where they keep the Glock in their pants, chopper's right in the car
And if you step up on the daily's you might leave with a scar
If your gang tight might leave with a broad and like two of her friends might enjoy a ménage
And that's night life, in Watts California
Parties ain't over till like six in the morning
This Hennessey's straight, gotta nigga zoning out
Take another swig then I'm rolling out
If you ain't banging better hold your mouth
Don't claim nothing that you know you're not

I'm the only nigga from Brooklyn out here man
I'm tryin to lock the spot down, holla at me Alright; hold on - Hova, line one Here's a couple of suggestions of how you could finesse it
You find a dude in town, you send him a short message
Say, Hey, I'm new in town, I don't know my way around
But I got some soft white that's sure to come back brown
I get that butter all night
Cause most niggas don't know a brick from a bite
They keep buying hard white
And if you free tomorrow night we can meet and discuss price
FYI, I never been robbed in my life
Or -- you find a chick, shit, you hole up in her crib and
Let her introduce you 'round town like her man
Shake hands, make friends like it's all innocent
Then -- before they look up you sellin the town cook-up
Or -- gorilla pimp, come up on that killer shit
Take a nigga brick, smack him, then you sell it back to them
Still there Brooklyn? Yeah yeah that's gangsta, I think I'mma roll with that one Make out a check for eight hundred dollars

You find a strip first, if you don't cook find a bitch first
If you don't hustle find a nigga who pitch first
You new in town, no red and blue in town, that's gangs
Don't get fresh, let 'em know you small change
The strong move quiet, the weak start riots
We know you got a brick but sell 'em twenties til they tired
With no credit, you know you sick with that gotta eat fetish
And other niggas who gettin it - DEAD IT
Make 'em an offer that they can't refuse
He resists, box him in, til he can't be moved
Here's the rules: chop it, bag it, stash it, stack it
Get in, get out - that's a O.G.'s classic
900-Hustler, you pass it around
Wanna speak to me direct, hit extension trey-pound, I'm out

Never play the house, think drought, keep heat in the couch
When you sittin in the presence of cus-tomers
Never hold out, pull out, throw heat and be out
If a nigga ever think that he touchin-ya
Lay low, get cake, whip all over the state

Make sure you got your four-four and he can slip if he like
Young, Jon Benet daughter missin tonight and yo
Until you up stay away from them dice and whores
Three smuts, two straights and a dyke
Cause boys want three bundles two streaks and pipe for sure

Imagine how it feel to watch another nigga at the top
You know that if you wasn't you, you would be dissin' you, dawg
Damn, okay, from that perspective
I see what you're talkin' 'bout, no way to soften that
'Cause me, I was tryna find out where I lost 'em at
But maybe I ain't lose 'em at all
Maybe I keep movin' forward and they're just stagnant
They ain't movin' at all
But when they need a favor, who do they call?
Maybe I'm searchin' for the problems
Askin' what was said and who was involved
Too focused on people's feedback and provin' 'em wrong
They say the shoe can always fit, no matter whose foot it's on
These days feel like I'm squeezin' in 'em
Whoever wore 'em before just wasn't thinkin' big enough
I'm 'bout to leave 'em with 'em
'Cause if I run in the game in these, man, the seams are splittin'
No pun intended but they're smellin' defeat in the air
Headed where nobody took it, who meetin' me there?
They tell him that he's talkin' crazy but he doesn't care
Bein' humble don't work as well as bein' aware
Listen up, boy, you're better off eavesdroppin'
We already got spring 2015 poppin'
PND droppin', Reps-up P droppin'
Majid Jordan droppin', OB droppin', not to mention me droppin'
Feel like we paid the refs off, man, we fixed the game
Me and Noel been at it before Twitter names
Yeah, been on the move like the lease is up
And I can't even name one person that's keepin' up
Damn, fuck how it was in the past tense

Shitty drugs and drama, opposite 3 pretty thugs and a don mama
Fill in the rest, the steel in they chest
When Boogs threw the kiss of death, it was over and we laid out

You know the steez, take aim, cock and squeeze
It's the prophecies, not the philosophies of Socrates
Next up? 
Aiyo 'Mega, represent for the family Aiyo, the Feds got me in the top ten
'Cause when my door got knocked in, my .44 main cocked in
My sinister mind shines like a Dillinger
'Mega exhausted, baby-faced crime emperor
Yo, life is based on cultures and creeds
And peep the way drugs feed a thug nigga's seeds
I've seen niggas lined up, handcuffed and tied-up
Coke prices rise when drug supplies dry-up
The Millennium drives up, rims semi blind ya eyes temporarily
Mind of 'Mega be heavily armed for felonies

High-class generals, confidants, payin' lawyers

Thug thought he was O.G. Bobby Johnson
I played him like Benny Blanco, mano a mano
You ain't ready, I fondle trigger straight up, shoot my guns horizontal, get your weight up, I am
Two point two pounds
You're barely a hundred and twenty five grams
Wouldn't expect y'all to understand this money
Do the knowledge, due to few dollars, I'm due to demolish
Crews Brooklyn through Hollis to a hood near you, what the fuck? Bring it on if you think you can hang Money is power, I'm energetic with facial credit
Pure platinum fetish for cheddars
Spread lettuce heroes get deadish
I make moves that remove pebbles out of shoes
You suck pistol like pipe with the crystal
John Stockton couldn't assist you
Convoys of Benzes like we fouling in the U.N
So what the fuck you doing? Whatever, nigga
Fahrvergnügen, rugged yet polished
Spanking dollars with the commas
Banging bitches out the Bahamas
On hides of llama we cry nada, fly farther
Fry hotter, you die gotta, fuck with me witness mañana
Absence of malice in my palace
Call cousin now Dallas trigger finger with the callus
Tip scales from mail to keep these niggas off balance

But with eyes shut, it's you I'm thinkin' of
But how we move from A to B, it can't be up to me
'Cause you don't know who I was before you
And basically, to see a change in me
I'd be losing, so I just ignore you, yeah
Oh, but you're on my mind, my mind, my mind, my mind, my mind
Oh, but maybe in time in time, in time, I'll tell you I'm A little bit, a little bit
A little bit in love with you
I guess that I'm a little bit, a little bit
A little bit in love with you I know you told me break their hearts
But it's you I wanna take apart
And I will never ever be the first, to say it
But still I, they know I
I would do it, push a button
Pull a trigger, climb a mountain
Jump off a cliff 'cause you're my baby
I love you, love you, a little bit
I would do it, you would say it
You would mean it, we could do it
It was you and I and only I, mmm : Lykke Li]
I think I'm a little bit, little bit
A little bit in love with you
But only if you're a little bit
Little bit in love with me I hope they never find out
What they already know, know, know
As soon as it's official
We'll have to let it go, go, go
So we don't confirm the fling
Keep avoiding all the questions
You could teach me many things
I'm just scared to learn a lesson
The pressure's on, both hearts beat like a metronome
Both in sync like a Justin song
Feels so right but it's just, so wrong
I wonder where my world 'bout
When niggas that I know tryna take my girl out
And her friends say I ain't the one to go for
She just jealous cause you always get approached more
Oh well, tell her fall back
Caught up in some more shit, tell her call back
Tell her get a man that ain't cheatin on her ass
Wit a girl that I know, yeah tell her all, that, that
And as for you, I think I know you're the one
The closest I've come, I'm probably a : Drake]

Made a couple of dollars, made a little bit of change, never looked back
You could find me at the shooter range, practicing bussin' gats
Or in the vocal booth, in this new studio, bussin' raps
With some gold on my body, out my body, off Carlos Rossi
I'm sloppy, I treat my luxury scraper like a Bugatti
La di da di, she like to party off molly, Bacardi
Love to get naughty, a hottie, up in the lobby, she stopped me
She said 40 Water, where you 'bout to be?
I said Follow me, follow me, follow me, bitch, room 223
You got to pay me or pay me no attention, that's how it be

Thick bitch, yeah, a big ol' ass, poke it like a cactus
And she got a face that belongs up in a beauty pageant
It's ya boy, Juicy J, trippy, I gorilla pimp
Balling hard everyday, ratchet bitches can't resist
I stay laughing to the bank but my dough ain't funny
I'll run out of rap before I run out of money
Love to pop a pill, that's foreplay
Now I'm all in her face like Olay
I'm like okay, I kill the pussy like OJ
When I'm finished with ya woman, she gon' think we soulmates You wanna be around the winners? 
Say you only had a few niggas? 
Girl, I'm just being honest 
I know what you want and he's not it 
I'm off the shits and I'm wit' it 
They can't stop us, we gon' get it 
I'm just being honest 
I know what she want and he's not it
That's why ya-- Lil Wayne Yo yo public service anouncment man
It's your boy- Weezy F. Baby, the F is for fuckin'

Cause if i was you, i would to
Dedication 3
Uhh, yo, you believe when they say we ain't shit, we can't grow?
All we are is dope dealers, and gangstas and hoes?
And you believe when they be telling you lie, all on the media?
They make the world look crazy to keep you inside?
Why you listen when the teachers at school
Know you a young single parent out struggling, they think you a fool
Give your kids bad grades and put 'em in dumber classes
Killing shorty future, I wonder how do we last it?
Underground in they casket, ancestors turning
I'm learning something every day, there is no Lazarus
Words like God is Greek or Latin
So if you study Egypt, you'll see the truth written by the masters
My niggas is chilling, getting high, relaxing
Envisioning, owning shit, yo it can happen
What do we own? Not enough land, not enough homes
Not enough banks, to give my brother a loan
What do we own? The skin on our backs, we run and we ask
For reparations, then they hit us with tax
And insurance if we live to be old, what about now?
So stop being controlled, we black zombies Walking talking dead, though we think we're living 
We just copy-cat, following the system 
Walking talking dead, though we think we're living 
We just copy-cat, following the system  Ayo, we trapped in our own brain, fuck behind bars
We've already gone insane
We've already gave up, cut our own heads offs
Stab our own backs and dream too much
Without fulfilling reality; too greedy and
Can't have one or two chains, we need three of them
Can't have one or two guns without squeezing 'em
On our own people and, fuck black leaders
'Cause whites ain't got none leading them, the rhythm is cosmic
Nas is divinity, the deity's prophet
Let's all get down and get up
Victims walking 'round with Down's Syndrome, all stuck
Fainting, shouting, catching Holy Ghost in church
Scared to do it for ourselves 'less we see somebody doing it first
We begged, we prayed, petitioned and demonstrated
Just to make another generation - black zombies Walking talking dead, though we think we're living 
We just copy-cat, following the system 
Walking talking dead, though we think we're living 
We just copy-cat, following the system  You scared to be yourself, 'cause you in a trance
Feel free, hear the music and dance
If you cared what they think, why wear what they wear, just for you
Dumb niggas with long beards like they Arabs or Jews
Or from Israel, Bismillah al rahman al rahim
Islam's a beautiful thing
And Christian and Rastafari, helps us to bring
Peace against the darkness, which is ungodly
So what's the black man's true religion, who should we follow?
Use your own intuition, you are tomorrow
{*roaring*} .. That's the sound of the beast
I'm a Columbia record slave, so get paid
Control your own destiny, you are a genius
Don't let it happen to you like it did to me, I was a black zombie Walking talking dead, though we think we're living 
We just copy-cat, following the system 
Walking talking dead, though we think we're living 
We just copy-cat, following the system  Wake up! Black zombies in a spell for more than fo'-hundred years
Ghetto niggas won't have it no mo', can I get a witness?
Why listen to somebody else tell you how to do it
When you can do it yourself; it's all in you, do it, do it
Do it niggas.. c'mon, uhh, peace...
Ya,uh
I was once told
You get your freedom
By letting your enemy know that
Youll do anything to get your freedom
Then youll get it
Its the only way youll get it
When you get that kind of attitude
Theyll label you as a crazy negro
Or they just call you a crazy nicca
They dont say negro
Or theyll call you an extremist
Or a subversive
Or a setatus
Or a red or radical
But when you stay radical long enough
And get enough people to like you
Youll get your freedom
So dont rum around here
Tryin to make friends
With somebody whos deprivin'
You of your rights
Their not your friends
NO.. they ya enemys
And treat them like that
And fight them
And youll get your freedom
And after you get your freedom
Your enemy will respect you, and will respect you
And i say that with no hate
Cuz i dont have no hate in me
I have no hate at all
So i say to you, Big Man
Im the man you think you are
If you want to know what ill do
Figure out what youll do
And ill do the same
Only more of it NICCA

Oh it ain't over muthafuccaz
Man, Beyoncé, I'm mad at you
Man... They say hello 
I can daydream about Beyonce all day
Thinkin' about the good times before she met Jay
See ya know
They say hello 
I really thought I had a chance to be your man
Until I seen the video with the ring on your hand
It hurt me so I remember you were 16 on the TV screen with Wyclef
Were you my type? Oh God yes, I was impressed
You was like no no no, I was like 12 years old
Hoping that one day I could chaperone while you were on the road
You wore braids with a bangin body
Look like you did pilates, a lot of sit-ups probably
But bump that, I was there from the start
Even when Latoya Luckett and that other doo-doo bucket broke your heart
Hope you didn't cry cause honestly they were just so-so
They couldn't sing anyway, you deserve to go solo
No disrespect to Kelly and Michelle I'm just sayin' they cool
But you? You are somethin' like Wonder Woman
And I just wanna hold your hand, bring you to Compton
Gonzales Park, we can build castles in the sand
Eatin hot cheetos with pickle juice in it
Put that napkin down, you know I'll lick your fingers when you're finished They say hello 
I can daydream about Beyonce all day
Thinkin' about the good times before she met Jay
See ya know
They say hello 
I really thought I had a chance to be your man
Until I seen the video with the ring on your hand
It hurt me so I just bought the Sasha Fierce CD
Gazed at the cover for a whole 5 minutes until my girlfriend hit me
She jealous of you cause I don't love her like I love you
I even make her do the uh oh, uh oh just like you do
She tell me I'm obsessed, I tell her we connect
Like Ice Cube way before the Mac 10 feud
She's like you goddamn fool, that girl's rich and you're broke
I said So? I'm only 500 mill away, theres still hope!
Anyway, I had feelings even way before you got paid
And I didn't laugh when you busted your ass on the stage
And I salute Kanye for takin' up for you
I would've stole the award just to prove that I love you
But Jay should've did that I thought he had your biz-ack
What happened, Mr. Izzo? Hopico? Fredrico?
He used to be my favorite until he abandoned my diva
Now I tell everybody Nas had killed him on ether They say hello 
I can daydream about Beyonce all day
Thinkin' about the good times 'fore she met Jay
See ya know
They say hello 
Hopefully I still have a chance
Maybe if I sabotage your man
You never know, hmm... I'mma sneak backstage at a Mary J Blige concert
With an I love Mary shirt, then find Jay-Z
And push him into a dancer, hopefully they lock lips
That's when I yell out Sounwave! Hurry up take the pic!
Put it on Bossip the same night, yeah, that sound quite right
Publicity like that? Yep, they'd be sure to fight
Better yet, I'mma steal her cell, then call up Affion
He impersonates Jay well, get Beyonce on the line
Then make up some bogus shit like You don't rub the back of my knees right
So this marriage is over with
And the ring thats on my finger? Guess what? I'm throwin' it!
...you heard the sound so you know I did
Haha that should get 'em
That should break em up like a Kit Kat when I do that, yeah, true that
I'mma put the plan in motion, that's for sure
But if I end up with Macy Gray, this plan never work Yeeeea, man I hope Jay don’t be mad at me bout this song
Start-ay, Wizzle start me back from like the first verse
Like right before I come in
Haha, what you say? Nah, you think it’ll be hot for real though?
Nigga, you stupid, they probably laughing as hard as you
Nigga got the best wife in the world and shit
Run that back though?
220 get dressed up, jumped on a boat
Fuck with my locs

It's a holiday, Crip, I'ma fuck with my locs
Get dressed, so fresh, big S on my chest

501's with the Stacy Adams tips
Picture a room full of Long Beach 20 Crips
Doin' this, who in this? You in this? We in this bitch
Wish the dead homeboys was seein' this shit
Neither, none, best 20 minutes or less
It's a C-Walk contest, who do it the best?
Right your set with the feet, skip along to the beat

I know you niggas don't see me as much as you'd like
'Cause I'm out gettin' money when I'm rockin' the mic
I'm a long way from Locus Ave, my locas have
Been there with me through the good and bad
Know look, let me reminisce, and twist a fuckin' blunt to spark
I got put on, '84 at King Park
Shottin' hoops with Charlie Mo and 
With the bumblebees, real east-side G's
Then go to  and ball out for any black ass
And wait for all the bitches at Poly to get outta class
I'm poppin' at 'em from a distant, but I'm persistent
That's some 20 crip shit
See I'm a dub motherfucker and all y'all know
So if you're with it, let's get it 432-O, come on

Nigga, you ain't know shit
Cut off a nigga head, make him suck his own dick
How the game go Money over bitches and flowers over snitches
Money over bitches and flowers over snitches
Mr., Mr. Scarface, pistol into yard fish

Mr., Mr. Scarface, pistol into yard fish

Yah Pushin' drop-tops, Stacy Lattisaw tapes, the 80's had us all apes
Youngest gorillas up to bat at home plate
That was a uncanny era, guns in my pants, yeah
X-Clan hair, with dreads at the top of my fade
Homicidal feds on the blocks where I played b-ball
That's when I wondered was I here for the cause or because
'Cause Ray Charles could see the ghetto
Was told to stay strong and I could beat the devil
'Cause yo, I used to play Apollo balcony seats
Watchin' niggas swing razors in the front row
Then out in the streets, the car show, 560's, chemical Afros
Acuras pumpin' Super Lover Cee and Casanova
Live chicks be asses bustin' out of they clothes
Wearin' lip gloss, big door knockers peelin' they earlobes
So where them years go?
Where the Old Gold beers and cheers go?
But now them shorties here though, so The doo rags are back, fitted hats, snorkels and furs
Rikers Island buses still packed, what's the word?
The drinkers stay drinkin', or puffin' they herb
And I'm still enjoyin' life's ride; one mo' time
The doo rags are back, fitted hats, snorkels and furs
Rikers Island buses still packed, what's the word?
The drinkers still drinkin', or puffin' they herb
And I'm still enjoyin' life's ride, right? Political thugs in shark suits persuade us to pull triggers
In army boots, yellin', Join the armed forces!
We lost the Vietnam War, intoxicated poisons
Needles in arms of veterans instead of bigger fortunes
There's still a lot of nigga crawlin' in the corporate offices
War in the ghetto, we crabs in a barrel, they torture us
They won't be servin' the beast too long
The murderers wearin' police uniforms, Confederate flags I burn
Beat Street breakers were dancin' to the music I chose
And Peachtree, Atlanta crackheads was tootin' they nose
In frozen corners of Chicago
Loaded-up llamas, children with fo'-fo's and double-revolvers
We devil incarnates headed for jail
Where Shell gas company in South Africa be havin' us killed
Your paper money was the death of Christ
And all these shorties comin' up just resurrect your life
It's like a cycle The doo rags are back, fitted hats, snorkels and furs
Rikers Island buses still packed, what's the word?
The drinkers stay drinkin', or puffin' they herb
And I'm still enjoyin' life's ride; one mo' time
The doo rags are back, fitted hats, snorkels and furs
Rikers Island buses still packed, what's the word?
The drinkers still drinkin', or puffin' they herb
And I'm still enjoyin' life's ride, right? Niggas used to wear rags on they hair when it was fried up
That's when we were lied to, buyin' hair products
Back before my generation, when our blackness started disintegratin' till awareness started penetratin'
The styles come from prison, they used potatoes makin' liquor
Just to prove we some creative niggas
Turnin' nothin' into somethin' is God work
And you get nothin' without struggle and hard work
War is necessary to my niggas in chains
From Green to Sing-Sing I'm wantin' y'all to know one thing
The hardest thing is to forgive, but God does
Even if you murdered or robbed, yeah it's wrong, but God loves
Take one step toward him, He takes two toward you
Even when all else fail, God support you
I done it, got God's Son on my stomach
My heart and my lungs was affected
From Henny's and gettin' blunted
Do your body right and it loves you back
You only get one life, and yo, because of that
I'm still blazin', goin' out for the cause
Still rockin' stockin' caps, not for the waves, obeyin' no laws
And it's like that The doo rags are back, fitted hats, snorkels and furs
Rikers Island buses still packed, what's the word?
The drinkers stay drinkin', or puffin' they herb
And I'm still enjoyin' life's ride; one mo' time
The doo rags are back, fitted hats, snorkels and furs
Rikers Island buses still packed, what's the word?
The drinkers still drinkin', or puffin' they herb
And I'm still enjoyin' life's ride, right?
Raj Smoove 
The greatest DJ in the world 
Ooh boy 
We about to say a prayer for all our loved ones
I'mma call this one Real Rap
Anybody you lost, put 'em on your heart
Because this rap is real, you know?
Light it up for 'em
I hope you ain't too tired to cry
And I hope you know
You ain't never too alive to die, heh Listen, I grew up where the people call them people on us
Think we slangin', but we just got beepers on us
Grindin' all day like we got sleep insomnia
Living like the videos, write a treatment on us
Stuck in the hood like they poured cement on us
Ghetto bird still shittin' on us
Government still quittin' on us
Lost a few homies, and the grief's still sittin' on us
So we got their names written on us
White folks still spittin' on us
And them bitchass police K9's teeth still grittin' on us
But we smoke, ashes still gettin' on us
Older bitches still hittin' on us
I remember well, Beezy rolled a L
Beezy ain't here — Where's Beezy at? Beezy got killed
And that was my nigga, I go way back with my nigga
But I know that's how it happened, my nigga
Shit is much deeper than this rappin', my nigga
But now they all rappin', my niggas
So now I must make it happen
So I'mma play the captain, sailboat flappin', my nigga
No fingers, I'm snappin'
Happy for my nigga Lil Tagus
'Cause even though we couldn't, the Lord saved him
Last time we seen him was when Katrina hated
Shit, found his body like a month later
Rest in peace, boy
He was a East boy, and so was Wessy West
He was a good nigga, so I know he blessed
And his daughter is a princess
This shit is harder than a bench press
But I'mma keep goin'
And I swear I got a lump in my throat
But I'mma keep on pumpin' the flow
So if I cry, don't stop the beat
I feel like my heart just stopped a beat
My nigga Lil Derek was quick to cop a ki
Either that or load the gat and go pop a G
And because of that he's just a name in a rhyme of mine
I pray his family and his momma's fine
So much shit just sit on this mind of mine
I think about it all the time, I drink about it all the time
I smoke back to back
'Cause if my thoughts got to me, I'd be in this rap
Or I'd be in the can
Thank God I had dreams of being the man
Yeah, and fuck a man with a badge
'Cause he ain't shit to a man on the edge
The 5-0 killed Naudy, good boy dead
Man, you would've thought they killed cornbread
Shot him up, face down on the lawn
Not to mention, with his handcuffs on
Not to mention, they had plain-clothes on
And the complaint goes on
But nobody do nothing about it
The jail house and the morgue is too fuckin' crowded
And hate is at an all time high
Everybody gotta hate, it's like a fuckin' iPod
Shit, and they tried to burn my Phantom up
But I got my gun license, haha, I got my hammers up
I'm ready to shoot like a camera —
Stay still motherfucker
I'mma have to write my will this summer
'Cause if they don't kill me, I'mma kill this summer
Yeah, and you can put that on my late Father
Or my late Grandmother, Miss Mercedes Carter
Or my Grandfather, Larry Balsock
The old man hustled 'til his heart stopped
And all I know of my real Pops is that he had money
No bank account, that brown paper bag money
Yeah, he might hit me off with a little brag money
But the nigga still wouldn't be a dad for me
But look how I turned out, I hope he glad for me
But that's why when I see him I acts mad funny
'Cause he's a joke to me
Don't message, don't call, don't talk to me
It's just me and my mama, how it's supposed to be
And I make sure she paid like she wrote for me
And I know she gets all hope from me
And I don't ever wanna see her mope for me
Hopefully, but, truthfully
There is a day that's due for me
But we gon' pray that it's as far as the future sees
You are listening to the future Weezy F. Baby
Amen Rest in peace to my cousin Kim Carbo
My nigga Vick
Rest in peace lil' Harold
Shoutout to my nigga Steveland! Rest in peace, pimp
Quiet Storm in the building

Puffin' on loud, that hydro
Still lookin' out for the Five-O
Been in the game, that's all I know
Never trust a bitch, that's all I know
Yo, that's all I know
Never trust a bitch, that's all I know
That's all I know
Never trust a bitch, that's all I know Put the mackin' in action, mulah in motion
Pull up on the ave', mashin' and yokin'
Only thing in my wallet, my ID and a Trojan
Nigga-rich negro, pockets swollin'
Kingpin, bitch, I ain't talkin' 'bout bowlin'
Big boy shit, pistol totin'
Custom fit, exclusive clothing
Iceman Nick, jewelry frozen
Better tighten up on your broad, 'cause she loose 
Not a caped crusader, I don't spin around in phone booths

She want me to save her, all I wanted to do was goose 
Professor Xavier, I'm in her mind, I got the juice
Congratulator, not a hater, I'm higher than Space Invader
Your bitch, she want me to lay her, I told her, Not now, later
She thinkin' I wanna taste her, she think that I like her flavor
I'll dig her out like a crater then break the bitch for her paper
BIATCH! Puffin' on loud, that hydro
Still lookin' out for the Five-O
Been in the game, that's all I know
Never trust a bitch, that's all I know
Yeah, that's all I know
Never trust a bitch, that's all I know 
That's all I know
Never trust a bitch, that's all I know 
My last slut, made my ass realize 
She'd try to fuck for some Nobu
A bitch ain't worth a box of french fries 
Kept me in the cut with some real guys 
Hypnotized by the bad bitch with thick thighs
40 said she a ghost so I gotta slide 
It's 4:30 AM, meet me at 5 
Take it to the car though, pour a couple drinks 
Only thing I like between your legs is that pink 
And I ain't tryin' to penetrate if the shit stink
Don't touch the shower bitch, you can use the sink
Got love for the Bay and they love the boy too
Freaks at the 'tel tryin' to fuck the whole crew
O.G. on me, O.G., what it do?
Get my nut off and kick her out like ooooh Puffin' on loud, that hydro
Still lookin' out for the Five-O
Been in the game, that's all I know
Never trust a bitch, that's all I know
Yeah, that's all I know
Never trust a bitch, that's all I know 
Never trust a bitch, that's all I know  Oh man, bet that money make her to a backflip
Hundred bands stashed in the mattress
Got four hoes like I did a hat trick
But I told those girls poof I need a bad bitch
She play a role, actress
Like Taraji, she a boss chick
Kill the game, I don't take too many losses
All I know is green like I'm playin' out in Boston
Out in L.A. don't be doin' all that flossin'
'Cause they'll snatch the chain, probably sell it at the auction
Ballin' in the city like J. Clarkson
You fuck with hoes who choose up hella often
You say she bad, well, I don't think she flawless
Saks Fifth, I don't really do the mall shit
Stop playin', got your chick up on my call list
She don't just want me, I think she want the whole clique Puffin' on loud, that hydro
Still lookin' out for the Five-O
Been in the game, that's all I know
Never trust a bitch, that's all I know
Yeah, that's all I know
Never trust a bitch, that's all I know 
Never trust a bitch, that's all I know 
Yeah
This on some old Tommy Campos Dice Raw” shit, you know?
For my niggas, though You underestimated greatly
Most number ones ever, how long did it really take me?
The part I love most is they need me more than they hate me
So they never take shots, I got everybody on safety
I could load every gun with bullets that fire backwards
You probably wouldn't lose a single rapper
Niggas make threats, can't hear 'em over the laughter
Yeah, that's 'cause I'm headed to the bank, nigga
Sinatra lifestyle, I'm just bein' frank with ya
I mean, where you think she at when she ain't with ya?
Wildin', doin' shit that's way out of your budget
Owl sweaters inside her luggage, you gotta love it
Damn, this shit could go on a tape
Bitches lovin' my drive, I never give it a break
Give these niggas the look, the verse, and even the hook
That's why every song sound like Drake featurin' Drake
Str8, Y pree? Why is it always me?
Got us watchin' our words like there's wire taps on the team
'Cause I show love, never get the same outta niggas
Guess it's funny how money can make change outta niggas
For real, some nobody started feelin' himself
A couple somebodies started killin' themself
A couple albums dropped, those are still on the shelf
I bet them shits would have popped if I was willin' to help
I got a gold trophy from the committee for validation
Bad press during the summer over allegations
I ain't lyin', my nigga, my time is money
That's why I ain't got time for a nigga whose time is coming
A lot of niggas PR stuntin' like that's the movement
And I'm the only nigga still known for the music
I swear, fuck them niggas this year, I made Forbes list
Nigga, fuck your list, everything's lookin' gorgeous
Without me, rap is just a bunch of orphans
But if I stay, then this shit is a bunch of corpses
And me and my dread nigga from New Orleans
Stashin' money like hoarders off multi-platinum recordings
Eatin' like I’m seated at Swish, Sotto, and Joso's
Nothing Was The Same, this shit for Ezee and Coco
This shit for Karim, this shit for Jaevon, this shit for Julius, Milly Mill
Boy, we do this shit for real
All them boys in my will, all them boys is my Wills
Anything happen to pop, then I got you like Uncle Phil
Weezy been on that edge, you niggas just need to chill
If anything happen to Papi, might pop a nigga for real
Comin' live from the screwface, livin' out a suitcase
But I'm feelin' good, Johnny got me pushin' two plates
My weight up, I refused to wait up, I started a new race
It's funny when you think a nigga blew up after Lupe
Niggas treat me like I've been here for 10
Some niggas been here for a couple, never been here again
I'm on my King James shit, I'm tryin’ to win here again
A young nigga tryin' to win here again — man, what's up? Yeah, a young nigga tryin' to win here again
If I like her, I just fly her to the city I'm in
I got her drinkin' with your boy
I got her fucked up, shorty, aww yeahAll I do is me, masturbation... Uh oh. For his new single, Canadian emcee Chris Varsity gets a verse from who 2 Chainz Check it out
I call it, yeah, yeah For my brothers with daughters, I call this
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
For my brothers with daughters I saw my daughter send a letter to some boy her age
Who locked up, first I regretted it, then caught my rage
Like, how could I not protect her from this awful phase?
Never tried to hide who I was, she was taught and raised
Like a princess, but while I'm on stage I can't leave her defenseless
Plus she's seen me switchin' women, Pops was on some pimp shit
She heard stories of her daddy thuggin'
So if her husband is a gangster, can't be mad, I'll love him
Never, for her I want better, homie in jail – dead that
Wait 'til he come home, you can see where his head's at
Niggas got game, they be tryna live
He seen your Mama crib, plus I'm sure he know who your father is
Although you real, plus a honest kid
Don't think I'm slow, I know you probably had that chronic lit
You seventeen, I got a problem with it
She looked at me like I'm not the cleanest father figure
But she rockin' with it For my brothers with daughters, I call this
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
Not sayin' that our sons are less important
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
Not sayin' that our sons are less important This morning I got a call, nearly split my wig
This social network said: Nas, go and get your kid!
She's on Twitter, I know she ain't gon' post no pic
Of herself underdressed – no inappropriate shit, right?
Her mother cried when she answered
Said she don't know what got inside this child's mind, she planted
A box of condoms on her dresser, then she Instagram'd it
At this point I realized I ain't the strictest parent
I'm too loose, I'm too cool with her
Should've drove more time to school with her
I thought I dropped enough jewels on her
Took her from private school, so she can get a balance
To public school, they're too nurture teen talents
They grow fast, one day she's your little princess
Next day she's talkin' boy business – what is this?
They say the coolest playas and foulest heart breakers in the world
God gets us back, he makes us have precious little girls For my brothers with daughters, I call this
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
Not sayin' that our sons are less important
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
Not sayin' that our sons are less important And I ain't tryin' to mess your thing up
But I just wanna see you dream up
I finally understand
It ain't easy to raise a girl as a single man
Nah, the way mothers feel for they sons
How fathers feel for they daughters
When he date, he straight, chip off his own papa
When she date, we wait behind the door with a sawed-off
‘Cause we think no one is good enough for our daughters
Love
Yo Nas
I don't think they wanna fuck with this
Gangsta shit, fo' sho'
Danger, danger
Check it out It's on, and once again I bring niggas the rough
Fuckin' with us, that get you motherfuckers touched
Hit in the darkest alleys, where the Super Sports rally
Beatin' up the block, leavin' these motherfuckers shot
They ain't ready for the Nakamici
I flip this shit like I'm Comaneci
Now dey a motherfuckin' see me
They try to breeze me, but I got niggas in New York
Comin' kama-kize, sparkin' this shit that keep me off the heezee
Game over, he with my man came over
To scoop me, blowin' dukey, in the black Range Rover
Nasir, tell these motherfuckers what we came for
Tell these niggas why we here Nuttin' but the New York to Texas connection
Nuttin' but some real shit, what y'all expected
Spaz out, some times dreamin', think I'm awoke
Harsh realities of life, hit me after I smoke
Money satisfy half of my mood, then there's a part of me
That's distant, quiet, the most dangerous side of me
I'm twisted like, Dr. Death, Kevorkian
Flip shit, white gun handle, made of porcelain
My, Houston niggas, come through for niggas
Scarface get a call and we shootin' niggas
Favor, for a favor, that's how we do business
Tryin' to make future figures, we two of the illest, what? You wet who I want wetted, I'll wet who you want wetted
Any nigga can get it 
You wet who I want wetted, I'll wet who you want wetted
Any nigga can get it 
You wet who I want wetted, I'll wet who you want wetted
Any nigga can get it 
I'll wet who you want wetted, you wet who I want wetted
Any nigga can get it You say you got a problem? Then tell a nigga where he at
So I can study his motions and peel his motherfuckin' cap
Where his brother go to school at? Find out some more information
Bout that bitch and hit a nigga right back
Cause when it come down to the come down;
I'ma pull the motherfuckin' plug on him
Walk up to his face and then gone
Set a example, send these hoes a little message:
They need to be more careful who they mess with, don't even stress it
Leaded, I pull these capers all the time
With the ugliest AK, I blow his motherfuckin' mind
Him and whoever standin' by, I'll tell these niggas, Let's go
And then we fin' to ride, and he fin' to die
He fin' to die, throwin' up his own blood
With a slug in his motherfuckin' mug
I do this outta love, cause your money ain't no good here
Just consider that as favor, until I need a favor You wet who I want wetted, I'll wet who you want wetted
Any nigga can get it 
You wet who I want wetted, I'll wet who you want wetted
Any nigga can get it 
You wet who I want wetted, I'll wet who you want wetted
Any nigga can get it 
I'll wet who you want wetted, you wet who I want wetted
Any nigga can get it A killer code, secret untold, how we bury beef with a rose
To his wake we send a wreath that explodes
Beneath us sleep with the Reaper, they sleep eyes closed
That's how real Brad Jordan keep it, to him I owe
Five fo-fo's ready, five masks, five machetes
Attack 'em like Freddy, then we toastin' over spaghetti
I share withcha drama, you share with mine
That's how we killin' two birds at the same time
Send my enemy's ear, I'll send your enemy's finger
With a pinkie ring, that's just a present my nigga
Either way the heat is grave, fuck with 'Face we bring war
Either, you feel these bullets or the Texas chainsaw
Not for popularity reasons, but for the love of the art
And you my heart, I leave casualties bleedin'
Cause we keep it death for a death, life for a life
Murder for a murder, and I got you it's vice versa You wet who I want wetted, I'll wet who you want wetted
Any nigga can get it 
You wet who I want wetted, I'll wet who you want wetted
Any nigga can get it

Any nigga can get it 
I'll wet who you want wetted, you wet who I want wetted

Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright Uh, and when I wake up
I recognize you're lookin' at me for the pay cut
But homicide be lookin' at you from the face down
What Mac-11 even boom with the bass down
Schemin', and let me tell you 'bout my life
Painkillers only put me in the twilight
Where pretty uh, uh is the highlight
Now tell my momma I love her but this what I like, Lord knows
20 of 'em in my Chevy, tell 'em all to come and get me
Everything I sow, so my karma come
And heaven no preliminary hearing, so my record
Tell the world I know it's too late
Boys and girls, I think I gone cray
Drown inside my vices all day
Won't you please believe when I say? Wouldn't you know
We been hurt, been down before
Hitta, when our pride was low
Lookin' at the world like, Where do we go?
Hitta, and we hate po-po
Wanna kill us dead in the street fo' sho'
Hitta, I'm at the preacher's door
My knees gettin' weak, and my gun might blow
But we gon' be alright We gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
Huh? We gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright What you want, you a house, you a car?
A piano, a guitar?
Anything, see my name is Lucy, I'm your dog
Look, you can live at the mall
I can see the evil, I can tell it, I know it's illegal
I don't think about it, I deposit every little zero
Thinkin' of my partner, put the candy, paint it on the Regal
Diggin' in my pocket, ain't a profit big enough to feed you
Everyday my logic, get another dollar just to keep you
In the presence of your chico... ah!
I don't talk about it, be about it, everyday I sequel
If I got it then you know you got it, heaven, I can reach you
Pet dog, pet dog, pet dog, my dog, that's all
Pick back and chat, I trap the back for y'all
I rap, I black on track so rest assured
I right my wrongs; I write 'til I'm right with God Get back
Look I started from the bottom, at the very bottom
Mixin' Hen with similac my momma knew I had a problem
I was jibbing for a bottom, putting quarter pieces in the black caprice and make it holla 
No releasing me, I got the piece in me, I gotta
Keep the decency and make them TNT my product

My nine is stuck in a holster
Dump quick
Chasing my dick
Made a bum bitch rich
Stalefish
Heard she naked in jail flicks
Mamacita
Black widow turned to be a back seater
Satin pillows a pimpstress in willow
Cookin my blow and heads low
Eye swellin
The son of the grain
I gotta split my wife's melon
So I can see the seven seeds of my circumference
Beaver lunged it
Polishin pistols at the gunsmith
Clever
My mama told me take cheddar
Buy slugs or drugs whatever calculate better
When cakes measured
Lock the front door secure
See the gleaming white crystal when its pure Fuck the snake hoes and jealous ass niggas
That smash your Benz windows
Detecting fake niggas signals
Yo live niggas get it too
Scarin rappers like the fed time Gotti was acquitted to
Bloodshot red eyes, high
Yellow envelopes of lye
Opening cigars let tobacco fly
Kicks matchin my shit my gun on
Thinkin of names for my mans unborn
Spill the Puerto Rican rum on imaginary graves
Put my hat on my waves
Latter Day Saints scream religious praise
Heat grazed the baby yo
Foul shit made a welfare mom crazy
More bodies drop by the ratio
Paces flow
Grisly thoughts for makin dough
Haitian bitch cast a spell on my life for cash flow
So now its on never wasted a slug
Time is money
When it comes to mine
Take it in blood
And when they hear that new Weezy

In the kitchen tryin' make a 20 turn in to a 100 
The pot runnin over wit hot water
Throw a 8 ball in it watch it come back harder 
The come back kid come back carter yea
That's what they screamin' loud as Aretha
And for them Franklins we pop at the ceaser
Ridin round with the whole block with the speakers

Back when i was puttin all my rocks in my sneakers
Yea but now i'm rockin ya speakers

Bussiness bad, fuck you pay me
Oh you had a fire, fuck u pay me
I'm might run through 80 in a week
But i can make a quarter million dollars off 1 street
Top in the game off one feet

As quiet as a mouse when you dippin through the street
If you lookin for some work you probably run into me

I'm the Birdman jr
I am a sinner who’s probably gonna sin again
Lord forgive me, Lord forgive me
Things I don’t understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch don’t kill my vibe, bitch don’t kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it but today I’m yelling
Bitch don’t kill my vibe, bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe, bitch don’t kill my vibe Look inside of my soul and you can find gold and maybe get rich
Look inside of your soul and you can find out it never exist
I can feel the changes, I can feel a new life
I always knew life can be dangerous
I can say that I like a challenge and you to me is painless
You don’t know what pain is
How can I paint this picture when the color blind is hanging with you
Fell on my face and I woke with a scar
Another mistake living deep in my heart
Wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick
I can admit that it did look like yours
Why you resent every making of this
Tell me your purpose is petty again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge
Even a small lighter can burn a bridge I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me then put me on stages
To me that’s amazing
To you that’s a quick check with all disrespect let me say this I'm trying to keep it alive and not compromise the feeling we love
You're trying to keep it deprived and only co-sign what radio does
And I'm looking right past you
We live in a world, we live in a world on two different axles
You live in a world, you living behind the mirror
I know what you scared of, the feeling of feeling emotions inferior
This shit is vital, I know you had to
This shit is vital, I know you had to
To die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain
Is way more believable, give me a feasible gain
Rather a seasonal name, I'll let the people know this is something you can blame
On yourselves you can remain stuck in a box
I'mma break out and then hide every lock
I'mma break out and then hide every lock I am a human who’s probably gonna fault again
Lord forgive me, Lord forgive me
Things I don’t understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch don’t kill my vibe, bitch don’t kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it but today I’m yelling
Bitch don’t kill my vibe, bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe, bitch don’t kill my vibe I'm really stepping up my game
These bitches gotta start paying me for this
Can't get no more free Randy Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot, it's a lot
Fuck that, never mind what I got
Nigga don't watch that 'cause I—
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me, all me for real
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me, all me for real Money on my mind, you should think the same
J's on, pinky ring—dogging these hoes, I need quarantine
In the same league, but we don't ball the same
 She want all the fame, I hear that shit all the time
She said she love me, I said, Baby girl, fall in line
Okay, made a million off a dinner fork, watch me switch it up
Walked in, Ill nigga alert! Ill nigga alert!
You need that work, I got that work, got bitches in my condo
Just bought a shirt that cost a Mercedes-Benz car note
From the A to Toronto, we let the metal go off
And my dick so hard it make the metal detector go off
This that sauce, this that dressing
Givenchy, nigga God bless you
If having a bad bitch was a crime, I'd be arrested  Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot, it's a lot
Fuck that, never mind what I got
Nigga don't watch that 'cause I—
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me, all me for real
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me, all me for real I touched down in '86, knew I was the man by the age of 6
I even fucked the girl that used to babysit
But that was years later on some crazy shit
I heard your new shit, nigga hated it
Damon Wayans, homie don't play that shit
I get paid a lot, you get paid a bit
And my latest shit is like a greatest hits
God damn, ain't no wishing over on this side
Y'all don't fuck with us, then we don't fuck with y'all
It's no different over on this side
God damn, should I listen to everybody or myself?
'Cause myself just told myself:
You're the motherfucking man, you don't need no help
Cashing checks and I’m bigging up my chest
Y'all keep talking ‘bout who next, but I’m about as big as it gets
I swear y'all just wasting y'all breath
I’m the light skinned Keith Sweat, I'ma make it last forever
It’s not your turn 'cause I ain't done yet
Look, just understand that I'm on a roll like Cottonelle
I was made for all of this shit
And I’m on the road box office sales
I’m getting paid for all of this shit
Ask you to please excuse my table manners
I was making room for the table dancers
'Cause if we judging off your advances
Then I just got paid like eight advances, God damn! Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot, it's a lot
Fuck that, never mind what I got
Nigga don't watch that 'cause I—
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me, all me for real
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me— Ho, shut the fuck up!
I got way too much on my mental
I learn from what I've been through
I'm finna do what I didn't do
And still waking up like the rent's due
Not complicated, it's simple
I got sexy ladies, a whole Benz-full
And to them hoes I'm everything—everything but gentle
But I still take my time, man, I guess I'm just old fashioned
Wearing retro shit, that's old fashion
Nigga, see what I'm saying, no closed caption
I paint pics, see the shit, good sex, need to hit
Keep a broad on the floor year 'round like season tickets
I plead the fifth, drink a fifth, load the nine
Leave you split, in the half, smoke a half, need a zip
My new girl is on Glee and shit
Probably making more money than me and shit
I swear to God I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one
I got 99 problems, getting rich ain't one
Like I got trust issues
I'm sorry for the people I've pushed out
I'm the type to have a bullet-proof condom
And still gotta pull out
But that's just me and I ain't perfect
I ain't a saint but I am worth it
If it's one thing, I am worth it
Niggas still hating but it ain't working
Lil' bitch... Oh me, oh me, oh my
I think I done fucked too many women from the 305
'Fore the end of this year
I'll do King of Diamonds 3 more times
Smoking on that kush all in our section
Like it's legalized
Girl, you can't always have your way
Sometimes it be like that
They don't really fuck with you like that
They ain't never did me like that
I just took my time, you got the shine
I let you eat like that
I been taught to never loan somebody
What you need right back
And I need that shit right back
 I’m blessed than a muhfucka
Niggas been stressed than a muhfucka
Niggas getting nervous
Clutching they chests like a muhfucka
Damn that’s a motherfucker
Tell the truth, I don’t listen to you
'Cause I don’t like being lied to
And that ship won’t sail
And that wind won’t guide you
Daddy was in jail, we was talking through the window
Like a motherfucking drive-thru
That was back then, man
Now my niggas rich enough to do whatever I do
Big chips! 
We off in Vegas drinking and partying
We got chicks in swimsuits modeling
We in the twin stretch Maybachs dipping low
The way the wrist shine it's so magical
You know them boys got the clubs out of control 
Nigga what ya heard, it's Kells and Hov
With the second coming of Best Of Both
In the first week I predict a million sold, we talking...  
Big chips! Big trips to Vegas nigga
Big cribs and the whips is spacious 
Any day they could dig your grave
Shit, so big is my inspiration, dig?
No reward unless the risk is taken
In which case you niggas wouldn't wanna switch places
I, on the other hand, relish the situation
Thank the Lord for the gift, I'm gracious
I went overboard, look at this big bracelet
I overhauled it, you wouldn't recognize it
From the time that I bought it I just replaced it
I risk cases for shit like this, nigga I pray for some shit like this
Word to my Uncle Ray, who gave his life for some shit like this
Ma, you rolling? I'm as real as it gets Big chips! I can't take this
The way you move your ass slow like Matrix
You make me wanna toss chips in Vegas
Before I toss chips, first, get naked
I can't fake it, girl you got the club shut down when you freak it
Superstar honey, so mean and vicious
Got a lot in common, I'm so mean and vicious
Bark bark farmer, this chicken laying platinum ex-farmer 
So go low mama, give it a go
As I punch 170 on stretch roads
Must turn up the radio
Girl you so good I'm swerving like 'Whoa, whoa!'
Uh oh! Uh uh oh! From the club to the stretch
Out the stretch to the hotel, into the hotel suite! Big chips! I'm a boss I said
Tilt my hat and I cross my legs
Like old ladies at the park, I toss my bread
And the pigeons start flocking, ballin' like Bishop Loughlin
And stick Cochran on any DA why try to stop him
So any gunplay, that is an option
I been doing this since niggas was wopping
Rockin Izods with the matching socks, and
Slap boxing in the back park and when the girls start watching
To try to get real, you had to drop 'em
See I ain't never been a fronter
Or fake it till I make it type nigga

You ain't gotta worry 'bout that, I'll kill a pussy nigga, put his head on exhibit
Come up missing, think they caught a big fish 'til his body come up drippin'
I treat her legs like like a grand opening, smiling while I cut the ribbon

Fucked so many times a nigga lost count, Lord
She say, I know you thought that you was about to get a quick fix, hit it, quit it
But you know you ain't been with a good, thick bitch in a minute

No matter how you slice it, I'm your motherfuckin' guy
And just like a b-boy with 360 waves
Do the same with the pot, still come back beige
Whether right or southpaw, whether pot or the jar
Whip it around, it still comes back hard
So easily do I W-H-I-P

 Kanye West
 I'm Rakim, the fiend of a microphone Uh yeah, is y'all ready for 20-07? It's now another drought
Everybody's a killer, wow, we buggin' out
Since '86 showing the crowd what I'm about
And they still wanna know when the album coming out
Ask the teenagers, OG's and nasty kids
What their definition of classic is
Timeless, so age don't count in the booth
When your flow stay submerged in the fountain of youth
Ain't no doubting the truth, I'm off the meters
Everybody cosigning, even non-believers
Since I came in the door became one of y'alls leaders
In a fresh pair of Air Force One sneakers
Uptowns, we call 'em uppies when they're on divas
Probably worn when KRS-One teaches
Nas made you look before the heaters
I bet you Kan' had em on when he walked with Jesus  Classic

 I'm Rakim, the fiend of a microphone You can't buy this Superfly-ness, like a shine is
Your Highness is performing; look how long the line is
It's what happens when you make shit that's timeless
It's what happens, these rappers is the pioneers
What do it take to be a legend like Nas is?
That's so novice, I'm so polished
I got a right to be a lil bit snobbish
I did a lil bit of college
Semesters, it took two, like Rob Base
To let me figure out this wasn't my place
The beat's slow, 'til you listen to my pace
‘Cause I be killing shit, but that's evident
And y'all feeling it, but I expected it
If it's classic, it's gon' last forever then
I'm everywhere you never been, and better than I ever been And now for my next number I'd like to return to the…

To them, it hurts to hear this
Oh, you went platinum? Yeah, that's nice
Now let me see you do the same thing twice
Three times, four times, then a couple of mo' times
Please, you're Amateur Night, it's Showtime
It's one life to live, so live it the best you can
The world could use one less man
Not enough air, not enough car factories
To manufacture new vehicles, sedans and vans
When they do make the whip you like, your chips ain't right
By the time you could afford it, the car ain't important
In the streets I'm in, it's just iron
Cops keep firin' in my environment
Leaving you slumped, then they drive home
Far from the hood, brothers they eager to jump on
I like to be the wall that they toast up on
I like to see them fall, guilty for doing wrong
I'm classic like the Air One's, the hustler shoe
That's what I'm accustomed to, yeah And now for my next number I'd like to return to the…

Me, I got no jewels on my neck
Why? I don't need 'em, I got your respect
KRS-One, twenty years I rock
I do it for JMJ and Scott La Rock
This hip-hop and we's a nation
Don't you wanna hear more KRS-One on your radio station?
Instead of broadcasting how we smoke them trees
On the radio we need to hear more local emcees
Where you at? C'mon, where you at?
This is the difference between emceeing and rap
Rappers spit rhymes that are mostly illegal
Emcees spit rhymes to uplift their people
Peace, Love, Unity, havin' fun
These are the lyrics of KRS-One And now for my next number I'd like to return to the…

America, please take my hand
Can you help me underst— Yesterday I got a call like from my dog like 101
Said they killed his only son because of insufficient funds
He was sobbin', he was mobbin', way belligerent and drunk
Talkin' out his head, philosophin' on what the Lord had done
He said: K-Dot, can you pray for me?
Been a messed up day for me
Know that you anointed, show me how to overcome.
He was lookin' for some closure
I can bring him closer
Spiritual, my spirit do no better, but I told him
I can't sugarcoat the answer for you, this is how I feel:
If somebody killed my son, that mean somebody gettin' killed.
Tell me what you do for love, loyalty, and passion of
All the memories collected, moments you could never touch
I'll wait in front a homie's spot and watch him hit his block
I'll catch the homie leavin' service if that's all I got
I'll chip a homie, then throw the blower in his lap
Walk myself to the court like, Man, I did that!
Ain't no Black Power when your baby killed by a coward
I can't even keep the peace, don't you play with one of ours
It be murder in the street, it be bodies in the hour
Ghetto bird be on the street, paramedics on the dial
Let somebody touch my mama
Touch my sister, touch my woman
Touch my daddy, touch my niece
Touch my nephew, man, I promise
You chip the homie, then throw the blower in his lap
Matter fact, I'm 'bout to speak at this convention
Call you back— The screen reads: This is a satire by Kendrick Lamar It's not a place

This country is to me a sound of drum and bass
You close your eyes to look around
It's not a place

This country is to me a thought that offers grace
For every welcome that is sought
Part II: DNA Run your life, I live a better life, I'm rollin' several dice
On your life, I live a better life, I'm rollin' several dice
Run your life, I live a--
Run your life 
This is my heritage, all I'm inheritin'
Money and power, the mecca of marriages Tell me somethin'
Uh, you can't tell me nothin'
I'd rather die than to listen to you
My DNA not for imitation
Your DNA is an abomination
This how it is when you in the Matrix
Dodgin' bullets, reapin' what you sow
And stackin' up the footage, livin' on the go
And sleepin' in a villa
Sippin' from a Grammy, walkin' in the buildin'
Diamond in the ceilin', marble on the floor
Beach inside the window, peekin' out the window
Baby in the pool, godfather goals
Only Lord knows I've been goin' hammer
Dodgin' paparazzi, freakin' through the camera
Eat at Four Daughters, Brock wearin' sandals
Yoga on a Monday, stretchin' to Nirvana
Watchin' all the snakes, curvin' all the fakes
Phone never on, I don't conversate
I don't compromise, I just penetrate
Sex, money, murder — these are the breaks
These are the times, level number 9
Look up in the sky, 10 is on the way
Sentence on the way, killings on the way
Won't you tell'em I got millions on the way Hi, I'm Dave Chappelle. And I just wanted to remind the audience that the only thing more frightening than watching a black man be honest in America is being an honest black man in America. Sorry for the interruption, please continue... Part III: Freestyle Yeah

Twenty twin twins, yeah, yeah Red light, green light, red light, green light
Red light, green light, they like, we like
Fast cars, fast money, fast life, fast broads
Egotistic, goin' ballistic, why God?
Born warrior, lookin' for euphoria, but I don't see it
I don't feel it, I'm paraplegic, tapped in when I'm maxed in
Comp-Town with the MAC 10s and the pumps in the background
Absent, never OG, standout
Lackin' everything else but doubt
Magnum, holding Magnums with a Magnum
Homie, ad-lib and I sing out loud
Never had friends, never had ends, never had hope
They was like, Nope, I was like, Boo yaow, boo yaow Is this on cable? CBS? It looks like it's singing and dancing, but this brother's taking enormous chances. Rumble, young man, rumble!
Part V: King's Dead Never had friends, never had ends

Well ate, on C4, I'm way off the edge
Burn integrity, burn your pedigree, burn your feelings
Burn your culture, burn your moral, burn your family
Burn your job, burn your land, burn your children, burn your wives
Who am I? Not your father, not your brother
Not your reason, not your future
Not your comfort, not your reverence, not your glory
Not your heaven, not your angel, not your spirit
Not your message, not your freedom
Not your people, not your neighbor
Not your baby, not your equal
Not the title y'all want me under

Graduated to a .38, now I'm hard
Practiced my aim up in the back yard
Had the flash on fools that scooped the heat
How I got my mothafuckin' name in the street
By now a nigga was straight bangin'
159th street is where i'm hangin'
380 in a stash spot, dash for the regal
Now rolling with the pistol was so illegal
But niggas was dying so, so fuck that
They in they league, got one and get your gat
Now it's 9's and AK's
And all kinds of shells where a dead body lays
But never take it as a threat
To  and dogg carryin' heat? Nigga you bet 
Parasites in my stomach keep me with a good feeling, y'all
Gotta see how I’m chillin' once I park this luxury car
Hopping out feeling big as Mutombo
20 on pump six dirty Marcellus called me Dumbo
20 years ago, can't forget
Now I can lend all my ear into how to stack these residuals
Tenfold, the liberal concept of what men'll do
20 on 6, he didn't hear me
Indigenous African only spoke Zulu, my American tongue was leery
Hopped out the gas station, a homeless man with 100 grand
Who passed me just asked for 10 grand, stressing about dry land
Blue skies, powder blue skies then crack open
Piece of crack that he wanted, I knew he was smokin'
He begged and pleaded
Asked me to feed him twice, I didn't believe it, told him beat it
Contributed money just for his pipe, I couldn't see it
He said my son, temptation is one thing that I defeated
Listen to me, I want a single bill from you
Nothing less, nothing more
I told him I didn't have it then close my door
Tell me how much how much a dollar costs?
And this a freestyle beginning
And if you know me you know K.Dot TDE winning
We are the champions, we disagree
You can't see it then you best believe
This the cypher, I need y'all to throw some words up And you don't, and you don't, and you don't
And you don't, and you don't, and you don't
And you don't, and you don't, and you don't
And you don't, and you don't stop They wanna know the question
K.Dot, everybody stressin'
This is the message that I'm kickin' too wicked, straight from Compton
If you come around my city you'll get stomped in
The neighborhood Watts and Long Beach
Boy, you out of reach
This is TDE, Ab-Soul, Jay Rock
Schoolboy Q, we hot, you not
This a freestyle off the top of the dome
Big Boy city, you know my home
I'mma represent every time I come to the lab
If you wanna see me, homeboy, get the cab
Cause you can't ride with me, you can't see the streets
You can't see us, it's TDE
My homeboy Dave gon' fly you straight in
Sippin' on that juice and gin and that's a classic
Coming straight from Dre and Snoop
If you want us please jump inside the group
Because you don't deserve it if you don't not
This is straight hip hop, this is off the top
And when I rock you feel it
If it's us and then you hear it
Please consider that the best agree
The top number one emcee Now when I flip it I flip the beat as my enemy
You thought it was taming me, on point like a widow's peak
Deliver the bars that everyone agree
They say the number one emcee, best believe
I love the pianos and I love the flow
I love the snare drum, I love... oh, I can't cuss on radio
Because if I do they just might let me go
I'm side to the best, I ride to the best
I represent the West, please don't try to test
Because you will get disabled
From best of flows I know, you hate it
Everybody wanna rock, but they can't
Because they come from the street of Rosecrans 
We drop it off the top of the backboard for real
And that's a swish, that's a net, alley oop
I feel that we are the champions and these Gods'll stomp you
I come through your block and crash everything that you want or put out to
And if you know my flow then you know how it go
If you know Death Row then you know Eazy, then you know Dre
Then you know Snoop and you know we don't play
But anyway I need y'all to flip the beat
Because my words always compete with the best I said we don't stop, boy, we run hip hop
Boy, we run rap, boy, this is Top Dawg
D-O-T, D-A-W-G, K-D-O-T, C-P-T
L-B-C West, W-A-T-T-S, Jay Rock, he don't play
Niggas and guards, projects
What you want? We can collide anytime with the biceps
But this ain't no strong arm, buddy, this just a freestyle
Off top of the brain, boy, you know I get wild
You know I'm so foul, you know I'm off of the top
You know this hip hop, you know I cropped
The roof from the birth of the Earth
And I've been doing this since church
With the small slacks, with the soft suspender
If you rapping like that, homeboy, we suspend ya
We contenders, we on the top off the map
We on the top off the globe and yeah this real rap
From the bottom of the soil since Adidas and Run DMC
Sprinting like cheetahs, we run this game and beat me
And  man on the beat right now
He gon' flip it and please believe
Every 16 bars is like ours
And if you want it then we 'bout to take charge, what's up? Tonight's the night I jump off my shit
Deep cover on the incognito tip
And every time the words flip the emcees step, but I don't trip
I keep walking, keep pushing and put 'em in a coffin
You often looking for the best, I'm here
We talking, you looking for the stress, you there
Keep walking, you looking for the West, right here
You stalking the flow, you often to know
I want y'all to know been doing this since the days of Death Row and Ruthless
I've been ruthless, the coupe it been roofless
You spit, the words be toothless
But it get like that because you feel it
I got Rikki on my side and she chillin'
Big Boy on my side and he willin'
They say that he writing my bars, forget it It's my lyrics, it's my pen
It's my paper as I begin
I've been writing for Kendrick for a long time
And he's been reciting my rhymes
So for those out there who didn't know
Big Boy gets on the mic and he kicks an ill flow
Then about 10 years ago I got this call
From a little dude, I said yes, yes, y'all
He said uncle Big Boy, I wanna start rapping
I said what's up, little homie?, he said I wanna start trapping
I wanna start capping, I wanna start hitting the studio
I said slow down a little bit, bro
He said holler, I wanna rock the spot
I said what's your name?, he said my name is K.Dot
I said K.Dot, okay, I think I feel you
But this the way I wanna instill you
First off let me write what you gon' say
Record it and then press play
He said okay, it was very rude that I took K.Dot on
He was one of my little students
So he just sat in class
He was looking at me, said do I get a pass?
Do I get an A,B,C,D,E or do I fail?
I said you doing well, his head started to swell
Then all of a sudden he came to me
He said there's this dude in Compton that has TDE
I said  Top Dawg? Hold on, that is my partner
Don't stop right there because I think 
When the dude is coming with a contract
But I said hold on, let me look at that
I said okay, he want this, he wants these points
He want this, but don't smoke any joints
You my lil partna, how old are you on the scene?
He said big boy I been a student, about, I'm about sixteen
I said okay keep going, and then all of a sudden
He started doing uhh, he started doing these shows
And he got poetic, he got energetic
Spotetic, all those -etics
Any more -etics, any more edits
Then o-etics, and then a o-etics
So then I came back and he was still in class
And then I gave em that pass
I said TDE, the real Macoy
Can't forget Jay Rock, can't forget Schoolboy
And so I put the whole crew together, but from the background
Before I got in they had a lack sound
Yeah, yeah, yeah
M-M-M-Murda
Yeah, yeah
Damn right, bro 4 AM, I'm just gettin' started

Got my first quarter flippin' fifty-dollar slabs

Cut from a different cloth, take pride in results
Anytime she wanna dip I'm providin' the sauce
You on side of the boss, so you kind of the boss
You keep playin' with me, I end up signing your boss

Yes! I'ma take this time out to talk to you about The Black Album real quick
It's a prequel to all my... uh.. all my albums
It's the activities leading up to my first album in '96
It's like the book ends for the whole career... you know
We gon' take it all the way back
It's a time peat circa '88 to '94 maybe 95'
We'll put a little bit of '95 in there, you know what I'm saying?
All the things that lead to songs like Friend or Foe or D'Evils you know what I'm saying?
You know all those activities you know what I'm saying? Yeah
It's ya boy Hov! We gon' take y'all back to school, real quick
The game is all wrong, business niggas is snitching and it's okay..
We gotta adjust the game, put it back where it's suppose to be
We gotta put back the integrity back in music man. You know what I'm saying?
Check it out! There's rules to this shit, consult the OGs
Before you dudes make one move on the strip
Before you move your lip, take the tool off your hip
I'll show you how to do this shit
I'll tell you what type of car to buy
What type of shoes to get
What type of jewels to cop, you could rule this shit
Manolo Blahnik or Jimmy Choo's for your chick
You gotta treat her right or she gon' mule your shit
Do you know the type of damage love could do
If she feels she's getting taken advantage of? Ouu!
If you wanna understand
Standing up like a down chick suppose to?
Here I'll coach you, Young ain't fake like most dudes
Young move weight like Cool J's trainers, it's a no brainer
And don't be wearing no vest with no banger
That just makes you a target
Young used to run the block, now I corner the market
'86 your bullshit, man get smart kid
But you ain't want to do no small bid
Incarcerated with the hard heads, acting like you hard head
That's all dead, get yourself the hog's head
Cheese, we could all get, R.S.V.P
Man we used to play dolls here, wet niggas with the faucet
Come through get your car ran, ran errands for the bosses
'Til I became one, now I got linen in the closet
I got the blueprint you just gotta follow it
Rule number one, real niggas never gossip
Rule number two, own The Black Album you gotta cop it Yeah man! We just gon' bring it back to the game man! Black Album, S.Dot
It's the collection, first non-athlete with a shoe, it's history baby...
I know you love me, you just don't know how to tell me, it's all good though
I love y'all too, It's ya boy. Guru! Fade it!
You plan to bang, I plan to bang too
You playin' the games, I'm seein' the thing through
You sayin' my name to entertain ya crew
I ain't playin' no games, when shots exchange you're through
Fresh off probation I got a charge to throw away
My lawyer say for eighty large it'll go away
And that ain't no money to Jay
So you could get it broad day on Broadway while TRL's tapin'
You playin the game you know you ain't gon' win
Quit playin them childish games with grown men
I don't give a fuck about cars or chrome rims
I got apartments you could put your home in
Can I live? :
Can I keep goin'? I wrote... Can I keep goin'?
Do not put my verse on y'all records dawg!
{Laughing} The boy trap money like bear hunters
Dear Summer, I know y'all gonna miss me
For we been together like Nike Air's and crisp T's
S. Dot's and Polo fleece's
Purple label shit with the logo secret
Gimme a couple of years, shhh, I might just sneak in
A couple of words and like Peaches & Herb
We'll be reunited and it feel so hood
Got the whole world sayin' How he still so good?
Well I do this in my slumbers, Summer
I ain't none of these half-assed new comers, you know how I do Summer
I drop heat when you bring the sun up
The combo make niggas act up I pick the gun up
Niggas back up they know I ain't no fronter
I don't talk shit I just flip and Un ya
Sorry Lance I'm just tryna advance my quotes
I ain't makin' you the butt of my jokes
Let's not stray from what I came to say
To my beloved, I think we need some time away
They say if you love it
You should let it out the cage, if not fuck it
If it comes back you should know it's there to stay
It's tuggin, at my heart but this time apart is needed
From the public, should've gave me the Pulitz'
But instead gave me they ass to kiss
But you know me, thugging till the casket dips
But still shine light down on all my peers
I know they weird, some queer, I still want them to share
In all the success I receive, I know you can't believe
I still love 'em but they don't love me
They like the drunk uncle in ya
{Laughing}
Though they lame it's still the same still you love 'em the same
Like when cats make subliminal records
Know they can't directly direct it at me I don't respect it
And you don't really want it with Hov for the record
I put a couple of careers on hold - you could be next kid
You keep entering the danger zone
You gonna make that boy Hov put your name on a song
If you that hungry for fame cocksucker, c'mon!
Say when, take ten paces and spin
But on another note I'm bout to take another va-cay on another boat
Goddamn a motherfucker rode his way out the hood
And I pray that I stay out for good
But any day you know a nigga could try to play like he Suge
Then I gotta pull it like Dutch Schultz
You pass the Dutchy I'll blast you trust me
Niggas can't fuck with me
I'm in a good mood y'all lucky
I'm in a good groove
And I ain't tryin to mess my thing up
But I will lay down a couple green bucks, get you cleaned up
Non-Pulp Fiction, Colt 4-fifth and
Young niggas that blasphemy, blast for me, no religion Yo, I'mma stop Flex, I don't want nobody to catch feelings
I had to take off the blazer, loosen up the tie
Step inside the booth, Superman is alive
{Laughing}
Folding this paper, getting my grip
Nigga, I’m a player, nigga, I’m a pimp
Don’t holla at me, these hoes is a trip
Don’t try to check me, you better check that bitch
Check that bitch 
Nigga It’s never too late to learn the game
Don’t call me trying to earn the name
If you don’t want shit
Trying to take up for that punk bitch
You hella square…I don’t fuck with it
All you gotta do is tell her how you feel
Just be honest, it ain’t hard being real
If she fucking with the next man, you gon’ be her ex man
And don’t let me catch you stressin’ Stressin’, let me give they ass a lesson, $hort
Some of these so-called players being acting like a dork
They get behind closed doors, they poodle up
Let they bitch treat ‘em like a mutt
There’s rules and regulations in the Book of Mackin’
If she ain’t your main broad you can’t be a captain
And even if she is, she better show you ‘speck
Just in case, always have another bitch on deck
BIATCH! Folding this paper, getting my grip
I came in the game already laced and equipped
Got the game from the G’s, the hustlers and the pimps
If it don’t make dollars, it don’t make sense 
I ain’t never been a square even though I drive a box
Had a couple warrants so I cut my dreadlocks
Tweeters, horns, woofers, 40 and them is what I knock
Slide down the block, life savings in my socks The homie got killed
The other nigga went to jail
All behind a female
He about to do life, he about to have a funeral
And nobody wins
Ain’t no game like a low budget pimp
Shoulda put a checkmark on her forehead
Stop simpin’ and tell her what $hort said I don’t know what you drinking
Must be drunk, what the fuck you thinking?
A real player, that’s all I wanna be
You mad ‘cause you heard she was all up under me?
Now you wanna text my phone like a bitch
You need to quit, with that little girl shit
You better check her, so you can live your life, mayne
Is that your real bitch or your side thang? Todd, I seen this main one in the club last night
Her and a couple of friends dressed in all white
Like some virgins, acting hella proper
Like they’ve never been touched, drinking hella vodka
Pants hella tight, grown
Coochie bite, camel toe, on
Wrecked, ready to get gone
You know why?  ‘Cause he ain’t never home
BIATCH!           
            Lyrics for this song have yet to be released. Please check back once the song has been released.
          
        
I smoke another to the face
Whenever I don't feel okay
It's gotta be another way
For me to get rid of my shade
Take narcotics to the face
Fuckin' up my brain
My emotions in a cage
They keep me contain
They keep me contained
She want me out her way
Shorty throw away the key
Love is not a game, I am not ashamed Bitch I'm fucked up, tryna clean the mess up
Yeah I fucked up, yeah I had to fess up
I'm a robot for her, love Alexa
When they say her name wrong it's Alexuhh
This is not an ordinary women
I feel like I love her to the fullest
Cupid ain't been shooting at me with no ordinary bullets
That's my biggest problem, I feel overhooked
Shit I was always scared of gettin' overlooked
Consequences in my side, I wish I never looked
Breaking up, never us
Fuck the time, it's forever us Whenever I don't feel okay
It's gotta be another way
For me to get rid of my shade
Take narcotics to the face
Fuckin' up my brain
My emotions in a cage
They keep me contain
They keep me contained
She want me out her way
Shorty throw away the key
Love is not a game, I am not ashamed Whenever I don't feel okay
It's gotta be another way
For me to get rid of my shade
Take narcotics to the face
Fuckin' up my brain
My emotions in a cage
They keep me contain
They keep me contained
She want me out her way
Shorty throw away the key
Love is not a game, I am not ashamed I smoke another to the face
Whenever I don't feel okay
It's gotta be another way
For me to get rid of my shade
Take narcotics to the face
Fuckin' up my brain
My emotions in a cage
They keep me contain
They keep me contained
She want me out her way
Shorty throw away the key
Love is not a game, I am not ashamed
Somebody remind me where I am
That's right I’m at home, yeah I’m right where I belong
Girl you say you feeling faded yeah me too
This smoke is getting blown, and these drinks are super strong
I know they ain't getting money like we do
So it’s on
I was looking for the one
Now I’m feeling dumb for thinking it was you
I was wrong
Now I’m back up in this bitch
Going harder than I did
Watch me do it And I’mma do it all
Feeling like the old me
You don’t even know me
I’mma do it all
I’mma do it all
That's probably why I’m back up in this bitch
Going harder than I did
Watch me do it Tonight I’m into breaking up
Somebody’s home
I’m drunk as ever
I’m not alone, 
I’m with my people
I know you love it
I don’t just do it
I over does it
I be getting money so long
Its just paper to me
Take all my memories with you and just erase it for me
You can never reminisce when you forget it all
Careful what you wish for, you just might get it all
Now my life is angel hair and pinot grigio
Baby forget about it
Im headed wherever this motherfucking jet is routed
You can’t have my heart the doctor told me I’d be dead without it My judgment's never cloudy
That’s why I’m steady yelling weatherman weatherman
I’m about whatever man
I’m tryna fuck with Tinkerbell in Never Neverland
But I’m polite about it
Baby after you
I’ve had a glass or two so somebody remind me where I am Tryna get the green like I’m waiting at a long light
Broke just doesn’t suit me girl and every night is prom night
Where’d I put my bow tie
Millionaire, multi
Rest in peace to BIG and praises to the most high
Getting stupid paid off of smart decisions
I’m the man now, I guess that part's a given
So someone please tell me the problem with my competition
I ask whats up and they just say the cost of living
I love from it though, I’ve been down and I got up
Bring a hundred thousand to the club and light your spot up
And me falling and landing in love shouldn't happen
Because everything's easier to get into than get out off
But someone show me to the owner of this city
Because the owners always seem to be the only people with me
I’m still the mafia, still run the committee
NY forever nigga, Diddy 
Yeah
I want all my niggas to come journey with me
My name is Nas, and the year is 1973
Beginning of me, therefore I could see
Through my belly button window who I am... I existed in a womb, just like an abyss
Came straight from spirit land, my hands balled in a fist
Punching on my moms stomach, kicking on her cervix
Twitching cause I'm nervous
Thought my intended purpose
Was to be born to reign, not in scorn or vain
But to take on a name, my pops chose for me
Bloodstream full of indo
Developing eyes looking out my belly button window
My father's face wears a frown
And I'm wondering if they even want me around
Cause I'll go back to spirit town
So I could rest longer before I come back down
The chute again, in the near future when
My moms and pops can agree on this
Was here before but my moms saw her gynocologist
He dumped me off, first they want me then turn around and they dont
You got a 120 days do what you want
But as for me coming back this be my last time
Abort me, keep me, give me away, make up ya mind I shot my way out my mom dukes They must wanna keep me, cause 4 months past and I'm still alive
Guess I got what you call an ill-will to survive
When I look hard the lights is killing my eyes
I know when moms is laying down cause I get bored and start to get live
Move side to side hear loud music and vibe
All black babies are born with rhythm thats no lie
Solar energize, mineralize food through my mothers tube
I'm covered in this thick layer of goo
Month two was the least most comfortable
My umbilical cord choking me
But month 3 was closer, see
Thats when pops took moms to see the doc at the clinic
But I was saved cause he changed his mind in the last minute
Watching 'em yell, heard my moms voice well
Feared fist fights, so terrified when we fell
While they broke up furniture and smashed plates on the wall
I wondered if I am born will I be safe at all
This place they call the world though my view was so large
Couldn't wait to get up, grow up and take charge
Month 5, Month 6 went by, hoping I'm born in July
But the Lord already figured out a date and time
Septemeber 14th, 73
Get ready world, doctors in the front waiting for me
Arms open cause they know when I drop, alot of shit's gonna stop
See how the goverment will start re-training cops
Month 9, I'm a week over due, the labor induced
Pops told my moms to push and take deep breaths too
Said stay calm, holding her arm, I'm trying to hold on
Surgical gloves touching my scalp, my head pops out
Everything blurry, my first breath screams out
Tears pouring down my pops face he's so proud
Wanted to hold me, but I was so bloody
They washed me off and he said At least that nigga ain't ugly!
Placed me in his arms snuggly, laid me on my mother
Finally, I got to see who held me in her body
She loved me,and I plan to over through the devil
Y'all bout to see this world in trouble
Motherfuckers...
Through the lights, cameras, and action, glamour, glitters, and gold
I unfold the scroll, plant seeds to stampede the globe
When I'm deceased, by then the beast arise like yeast
To conquer peace leaving savages to roam in the streets
Live on the run, police paying me to give in my gun
Trick my wisdom with the system that imprisoned my son
Smoke a gold leaf, I hold heat, nonchalantly
I'm raunchy, but things I do is real it never haunts me
While, funny style niggas roll in the pile
Rooster heads profile on a bus to Rikers Isle
Holdin’ weed inside they pussy with they minds on the pretty things in life
Gettin' props is a true thug's wife
It's like a cycle, niggas come home, some'll go in
Do a bullet, come back and do the same shit again
From the womb to the tomb, I presume the unpredictable
Gun salute life rapidly, that's the ritual Here's a toast to my foes, trees, & women

It's like a whole new beginning...
Here's a toast to my foes, trees, & women

It's like a whole new beginning...
Here's a toast to my foes, trees, & women

It's like a whole new beginning...
Here's a toast to my foes, trees, & women

It's like a whole new beginning... Blunts, thugs and alcohol, what a mixture
Just picture, ya life as a whole judged in court they convict ya
They telling you your state of mind, like you worthless
So he curses, his mom saying Bible verses
That's all she works with
But miracles never leave the churches
Instead, it hits the pockets of the Preacher just to purchase
A house, with a swimming pool, labels me a sinning fool
I'm just a nigga who inherited a winning jewel
To be a trendsetter, whenever subject to
Respect this and all respect due is the essential
To street life, hustlin’, the struggle, broke ghettos
Boiling coke settles slow inside a glass kettle
Darren Levy on my TV, lifestyles of living easy
Got my crew tense, plottin’ to jips, to get whips with BBs
Pushing cakes, knew anorexics with ten plates
Celebrating elevation in the seeds that we make
So How You Like That? Here's a toast to my foes, trees, & women

It's like a whole new beginning...
Here's a toast to my foes, trees, & women

It's like a whole new beginning...
Here's a toast to my foes, trees, & women

It's like a whole new beginning...
Here's a toast to my foes, trees, & women

It's like a whole new beginning... Escobar life, gems and raw Tims
Gators for pretty boy haters
In Vegas with chicks trickin’ fortunes
I'm glistening, housing cops whistling
Still I'm drifting in a high, blunts is like insulin
95-I, I drive high, zoning
Stash box zone in my trunk, I flash not, teeth golden
Look at me now, Ma
Blowin’ but for how far?
Cars, cash, and bitches got me out more
And things you never dreamed I can vouch for
Snake niggas slither on the A-alikes
I ain't a Christian, but I find that we pray alike
Never the one to ask for the time to a saint
A mask and nine, I think, will make my problems sink
Down a canal, similar to how we drink
Distinct diamond-flooded Sphinx shines on my links
Drug money, snortin’ bitches, in the end of times
Got my nine, 'til I flatline, nigga, give me mine Déjà vu....
See we ain't got much in common, so we don't do that much talking
Sometimes it feels so awkward
She watch me take a shower, I asked her why she didn't join me
She said because you didn't ask me; I said, Damn, I didn't think I had to
Then she take off my towel, and I-I take off her blouse
I tell her that that pussy for me, just in case she thought it was ours
And she say cool And if you like it I love it
If she like it I love it See we ain't got much in common, so we don't do that much talking
Cause every time she try to tell me something, she open up her mouth, I stick my tongue in
She got a piercing in her vagina, a skirt with nothing under
And she say when she don't see me, she feels like Stevie Wonder That's when I said, Work, work, work
If you want that purse, skirt, shirt
And she made me cum 100 times
She made me cum 100 times
Man, she got that work, work, work
I say you my bitch now, I'm calling you first
And then made her cum a 100 times
She kinda green but I'm color blind See we ain't got much in common, so we don't do that much talking
Sometimes it feels so awkward
She watch me take a shower, I asked her why she didn't join me
She said because you didn't ask me; I said, Damn, I didn't think I had to
Then she take off my towel, and I-I take off her blouse
I tell her that that pussy for me, just in case she thought it was ours
And she say cool Uh, I like that shit
And she bite that lip when she like that dick
Ooh, I like that shit
And she bite that lip don't fight that dick girl, girl
Fucking with you, well, I'ma need another shower
I'ma need another shower
Can you help me take another shower?
Then we gonna make each other shout There's steam in the air, fog everywhere
She can get her hair wet cause it's her real hair
I be like, Hell Yeah
And she be like, Fucking right
Now she got one leg in the air, I'm pulling on her hair
And she say I can pull it, cause it's her real hair
She be like, Hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah cause I fuck her right That's when I said, Work, work, work
If you want that purse, skirt, shirt
And she made me cum 100 times
She made me cum 100 times
Man, she got that work, work, work
I say you my bitch now, I'm calling you first
And then made her cum a 100 times
She kinda green but I'm color blind Then I said, See we ain't got much in common
So we don't do that much talking
Sometimes it feels so awkward
Yeah, this dedicated to Canada man
The whole up North
A lot of people don't realize how cold it gets during the Winter
But listen I met this new girl late June or early July
I called her a bunch of times but she barely replied
Now it's December, I'm driving, and she's like Where's my hi?
It's weird that I never called you cause I rarely get shy
See that was a segue, I believe the matter
Is what happens after the season where the leaves just scatter
Where the Timb' laces get tighter and parka hoods flip up
Drug dealers standing in their park or hood slip up
Where girls become exes from Summer's caught ho'in
The winter cars come out, the summer cars go in
And some places is breezy, and some it start snow-ing
And if you planning family vacations you better know when
But some mothers scared to send they daughters out the city
Instead she get a sweater that she bought her out of pity
Cause mom stays up late, she seen them videos
Where Cancun college students pouring water on their titties! Yeah man, it's a funny thing going through the winter up here man
A lot of girls y'know, wanna get close. you might think they the one
But just wait, nah mean, take it slow Forget to mention, this girl that never gets to the beach
She lives just West of my street, and so we destined to meet
Since I'm driving, I ask her how to get to the suite
She doesn't answer, opens the door and just gets in the seat
She throws her bag in the back, and starts adjusting the heat
She's bold but I roll with it, I'm impressed cause she's sweet
Then she says I heard your song and I'm obsessed with the beat
I mean, the lyrics are good, but I'm obsessed with the beat
I love it when Voyce sings and the chorus is good
There's a couple things in the song that I suggest you repeat
Off this I'm kinda taken back for a second
I get her number she tells me to call her after this session
And so I do, and it's kind of awkward, the surface hard to scratch
Until we end up sexin' and now my heart attached
I'm thinkin off I should've been more Southern
And realizing all that she wanted was that indoor lovin' and ho! Yeah, uh, I told ya'll I had a story for you right
Uh, ya man, it's what it is And now, I'm proud to have her like Montreal to the frizzench
She love to play hurt like Carter did on the bizzench
But, my boy say I'm actin different, because I lay downtown
And I still I rush to pick her up from work and fizzench
She tellin everyone I'mma hold here down
Tell everyone I'm the prince up in this cold clear town
And stupid me I just listen to her
Instead of wondering if this is really gon' last me the whole year round
But then Spring shows up, and it's Dallas in this bitch
The weather starts to resemble the holidays she missed
When we were together it seeming like way back when
Ball players hop on the plane and make it way back in
See she used to play piana, and now she never wait for santa
Instead of saving for marriage, she saving for caribana
And it's a shame, she had me convinced that she could've been a dime
I guess, I lost another one to the wintertime I miss you, most of all, my darling 

 Strolling in the park 
And watching winter turn to spring 

Strolling in the park and watching winter turn to spriing

 I remember them encore PMs, breakfast and the wake up
Now Drake's committed we waiting on the breakup
So we can get back to them cognac nights
With dress codes and light skinned girls that won't act right
And I laugh cause my previous lifestyle was quite wild
The winter came and blew his cold air through
Back then light sweaters and a couple drinks might get her
By the end of the week I would know that crew
And we'd assembled a trio, a whole new scene
With three ladies in the shot we never broke routine
At the end of every cut when the cameras are rollin'
We had ladies hearts always gettin damaged and stolen
But this Summer is different it's a two man operation
Granted the fact that we one man short
Got love for him he can watch this new man stop a nation
Cause handlin' crack is a one man sport
Instead of dress-up, I walk in sweat pants and charms clinkin'
I find a girl we step dance and calm drinkin'
The face, the breast, the bras, the toes
I'm still solo and a long night draws to a close
Cause it's a fact, if she come to the crib and I get some ass inside
We'll never talk again, scary and true
That song Special I recorded with Voyce well it's like a classified
It's what I'm lookin for to carry me through
Yet I can't seem to find it, every girl that possesses it
Only wants a friendship causing me to forget the shit
And when they talk about they past and lovers
And you get mad at the thought of it giving ass to others
Yet you find peace with yourself, now least there's some room to ride
There's also Room For Improvement as soon as June arrive Strolling in the park, and watching winter turn to spring
Strolling in the park, and watching winter turn to spring
Strolling in the park, and watching winter turn to springDiamonds hang around my neck, the crib is all finished
No love for these bitches I said this year it’s all business
It is a shame that a couple of ‘em are off limits
No offence to my nigga, it’s just the industry is small
We all lust for the same women
You know the ones we saw before we came in it
I know he ain't trippin’
I know I got a couple things that Lil’ Wayne dipped in
Ain't ashamed to admit it, I be the same with it
This shit is all about hits and misses
The ones that you fuck and the ones that you wife up
Don’t let them fuck your life up
Half a mill to perform, I can’t let them fuck that shit up
Plus I love the way my middle name looks when it’s lit up
Jim Moore got me dressing like a leading man
A little favour for a friend when I need a hand
Young Frank, suits cut right always
Just got a couple Warhol’s for my hallways
New verses crush the hood like I’m driving into something
Bitches on the kid like I’m Iverson of something
Like a Sixer, since I sold 680 in my first
Drizzy Drake, the only one that got the gift without the curse
Swag!Intro: You're back now at the jack-off hour this is DJ, Eazy Dick
On W-Balls, right now, somethin new, by Snoop Doggy Dogg
And this one goes out to the ladies, from all the guys

Here tonight, this is DJ Eazy Dick, on the station that
Slaps you across your fat ass, with a fat dick Verse One: Nate Dogg
When I met you last night baby
Before you opened up your gap

But now I take it all back
Cause you gave me all your pussy
And ya even licked my balls
Leave your number on the cabinet
And I promise baby, I'll give ya a call
Next time I'm feelin kinda horny
You can come on over, and I'll break you off
And if you can't fuck, that day, baby
Just lay back, and open your mouth
Cause I have never
Met a girl
That I love
In the whole wide world Verse Two: Kurupt
Well, if Kurupt gave a fuck about a bitch I'd always be broke
I'd never have no motherfuckin indo to smoke
I gets loced and looney, bitch you can't Do Me
Do we look like BBD, you hoochie groupie?
I have no love for hoes
That's somethin I learned in the pound
So how the fuck am I supposed
To pay this hoe, just to lay this hoe
I know the pussy's mines, I'ma fuck a couple more times
And then I'm through with it, there's nothing else to do with it
Pass it to the homie, now you hit it
Cause she ain't nuthin but a bitch to me
And y'all know, that bitches ain't shit to me
I gives a fuck, why don't y'all pay attention
Approach it with a different proposition, I'm Kurupt
Hoe you'll never be my only one, trick ass beeeitch! : 
It ain't no fun, if the homies can't have none Verse Three: Snoop Doggy Dogg
Guess who back in the motherfuckin house
With a fat dick for your motherfuckin mouth
Hoes recognize, niggas do too
Cuz when bitches get skanless and pull a voodoo
What you gon do? You really don't know
So I'd advise you not to trust that hoe
Silly of me to fall in love with a bitch
Knowin damn well, I'm too caught up with my grip
Now as the sun rotates and my game grows bigger
How many bitches wanna fuck this nigga named Snoop
Doggy, I'm all the above
I'm too swift on my toes to get caught up with you hoes
But see, it ain't no fun, if my homies can't get a taste of it
Cause you know I don't love em Verse Four: Warren G
Whoa!
Hey, now ya know, inhale, exhale with my flow
One for the money, two for the bitches
Three to get ready, and four to hit the switches
In my Chevy, six-fo' Rad to be exact
With bitches on my side, and bitches on my back
So back up bitch cuz i'm strugglin, so get
Off your knees and then start jugglin
These motherfuckin nuts in your mouth
It's me, Warren G the nigga with the clout
Whoo! 
 x4
 Whoo!...Ladies and gentlemen...
 You're now about to witness the power of...
 H, to the Izzo... and...
 Shady ... It's showtime Yo, gather round hustlers that's if you still living
And get on down, to that ol' Jig rhythm
Here's a couple of jewels to help you get through your bid in prison
A ribbon in the sky, keep your head high
I, Young 'Vito, voice of the young people
Mouthpiece for hustlers I'm back motherfuckers
Your reign on the top was shorter than leprechauns
Y'all can't fuck with Hov', what type of X y'all on?
I got great lawyers for cops so dress warm
Charges don't stick to dude he's teflon
I'm too sexy for jail like I'm Right Said Fred
I'm not guilty, now GIVE ME back my bread
Mr. District Attorney I'm not sure if they told you
I'm on TV every day, where the fuck could I go to
Plus - Hov' don't run, Hov' stand and fight
Hov's a soldier, Hov' been fightin all his life so
What could you do to me? It's not new to me
Sue me; fuck you - what's a couple dollars to me?
But you will respect me, simple as that
Or I got no problem going back
I'm representing for the seat where Rosa Parks sat
Where Malcolm X was shot, where Martin Luther was popped
So off we go, let the trumpets blow
And hold on, because the driver of the mission is a pro
The ruler's back  x4 Uhh, uh-huh uhh uhh
I, am, BACK, niggas -
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Turn the motherfucking music up
 Can't leave rap alone the game needs me
Give me the mic, show me where the fucking studio's at There's never been this, much of a menace in this game as this
And it's the, most sinister duo in the business
Once again its the, illest and realest killas
The most villainous Dre protege, Shady apprentice
Drop them zeros and get with these heroes
Do you want losers or winners, this music is in us, and it's
Not over 'till we say it's finished and G-Unit spinners
Will keep spinning, this is Hip Hop when it's in it's
Truest form, the greatest, Hate us or love us
Make voodoo dolls of us and keep stickin' those pins in us
Thick as his skin is or as short as his wick is
The trick is to be able to walk big as his dick is
And as sick as his music is, or was, still is
Whatever, forever, he will be the illest
To ever sh-shock the world, what to do next
He's already reconciled with his ex, a chainsaw and an axe
Jump a bitch's desk, strangle her neck
While we have sex while Bill Clinton plays the sax
I sprays the vex, yeah bring Shady on back
The maniac of rap, devil baby on crack
Resurrect, I never left, baby I'm bad
I've gone mad, my comrade Dre-zy automatically
He says I'm too broke to fix, way beyond that
I may be off drugs, but it's made me off track
In fact, this right here very well could be the last rap
I ever do spit, I'll never do shit, that's that
Fuck it I quit, suck on a dick, jackass
I'm done with this wack ass rap, kiss my black ass  x4
 Can't leave rap alone the game needs meThis one for the legend I feel like a king with these other niggas present we should take another night lost as a lesson hopefully imma meet these niggas up in heaven I feel like I'm lost in my mind sometimes I feel like I'm drop like I'm dying sometimes I'm just Tryna find when that was my sometimes I'm just tryna find when that was my sometimes ay I get lost in the sauce way to often buy my soul back like I fucking sold it this shit gold this shit golden I wonder what will happen when my life is over ay some times I think it's coming up I think they running up yes so imma keep my 40 tup I can not go out I can not go out I will not go out I gotta show out I ball on these niggas to hard I can not blow out Ye it's the blow out

And get fucked by the millisecond
Duck when I pull the weapon from out of my mouth 
Shots at you like a sawed-off
Aiming for your grill like I'm Paul Wall
Then peal 'til I not y'all
My cerebral cortex is like a war vet
Sharing war stories with the deceased, I'm brain dead
Straight bananas, I never gave a fuck
'Bout anything but my momma, my daddy, siblings, and grandma
And if you neither one of them, then I gotta answer
Every question with a bullet hole in my hammer
Like VH1, that's far beyond your comprehension
Like a deaf person showing up to court for a hearing
Who they fearing? K. Dot
Tickle the nipples of women
Make your bitch grab her crotch when she hear my shit, bitch! K. Dot got the unorthodox flow
On fire, make a rapper burn his soul
Murder for hire, acquire choirs for funerals
Numero uno, city in my rearview
Compton on my back like the titties of my masseuse
Pity, here you fool who?
Go against me, I rebuke thee
And wake thee up, six in the morning
With the pump, punks jump up to get beat down
Jump shot, coroners catch them on the rebound
Pans, pots, plates, bowls
I'm in your kitchen eating your stove
I'm hungry and hibernated
I'm cold as Miles Davis
I load up then I aim it
No judgment for the plaintiff
It only gets more heinous, nigga I'm brainless
Like a blind bitch who don't suck dick
Dinosaur manure, big shit
Smell me or die quick, fucka!



 I can stand in a pool of gasoline lighting a blunt and never catch on fire
 Silly motherfucker, I'm fire
Smack the devil over the cheek, gave him a third degree burn
Iced it down when he was asleep, and said you'll be okay
A lot of rappers are desperate to be a star by the day
They hydroplaning, hoping that they get their big break
I'm just saying, I feel I'm the one
Like a magician with a stick inside his hand, or the name of a mexican
I gets ignorant with ya
Snap me a picture, bitch, I'm famous
I came in this world nuts in my palm and drinking Paul Masson
In a stolen Cavalier like I took LeBron
Locked him in a basement and amputated his shooting arm
 Now that's a stretch Ab-Soul
Like a fifty mile strip when I'm pimping these hoes
Call me Dolomite, nope I take that back
Found out he gay as a happy day or the way that you rap
 (K. Dot got the unorthodox flow
On fire, make a rapper burn his soul
Murder for hire, acquire choirs for funerals)


B-I, what up?
Long as I got a voice, you got a voice my nigga
Yessir BK stand up, Brooklyn throw your hands up
If you with me, lick a shot for Biggie Chillin' in the spot in my B-Boy stance
Don't make this four-fifth kick like Bruce Lee roy pants
You know I'm smarter than Spock, for Leonard Nimoy fans
So this aluminum will foil your plans, that's how I'm doin' em man
I keep two in hand, in case I've been drinkin'
Seeing double, I got one for you and your twin
I got a nickel for your thoughts, make your blood trickle
Leave your smarts on the sidewalk, 'til the cops come and get you
I'm done playin' with you
The guns sprayin' with or without you
Make your body whistle without you, Young!
I'm still official without you
Still that nigga all the bitches whisper about, ooh
He's so terrific, his lyrics like it's about you
You can't tell me that everything he spits that it's not true
I'm from a crack in the wall, a fighter with my back against wall
Took a lighter, left my name in the hall, Young! Grew up on Lexington Ave, my socks real high
Moved to the Marcy Projects 'round the time I was five
Had a great-grandmother in the heart of the 'Stuy
So on the Fourth of July, we would always stop by
Man, I ran through the bush, bought pounds from the dreads
They had the best beef patties and cocoa bread
Played the Albee Square Mall 'round the time I was gettin' tall
Where niggas would snatch your pockets, leave your change on the floor
18 regime round then, Pink houses, Fort Greene niggas they ain't blend
Wasn't safe on the A train, D, G or the F
Decepticons, Lo-Life niggas snatch the Polo off your chest
East New York, Bushwick, fuck it, the whole BK
Brownsville, where the warriors come out to play
Nigga you better roll deep goin' through Coney Island
'cause it's one way out, nigga, one way in, nigga Everywhere you go, Brooklyn's in the house, if you soft tuck your chain
The crooks is in the house, yes, the jooks is in route
The drama's on the way
Stare downs first, then the llamas gon' spray
Momma's gon' pray
But we respect real, you act like a sheep, you gon' be the next meal
The wolves is on the job
Gotta get in where we fit in
Not rid the show and the kids is growing
Baby need new shoes, and you sitting on 22's
And we got guns big as Samoans
And you in the spot showing off like Terrell Owens
Hell I'm on this nigga
You better hold your ground, if you a straw house
Then the fours will blow you down and its back to the home town, yes!  High speed chase, 405 is the freeway
Swangin' my bangin' my swangin' my Coupe
DeVille Scoop! DeVille, like that, right back
Top of the hill, wheel in my hand with a trunk full of contraband
Swimmin' under water like I'm Aquaman
I used to drink gin, now it's vodka, man
Boss Dawg is the baller, no propagand'
Pop yo band, don't try and stop the plan
Rocky land, step back and pop yo man
Spaced out, caked out, no bug a boo
Flipped out, Cripped out, nigga, what it really do?
Time brings change, so I changed my name
Tryna take flight while they clippin' my wings
Groupie ass niggas see ya tripping the game

Can a blind man see? 
Can a shark survive outta water for a week? 
A snitch is a snitch if he solemnly speak

Spittin' game through the platinum smile

How I hop out of the colossal Tahoe filled up with models
Poppin' bottles with pussy poppers that gobble until they swallow
See I'm a pimp Playboy when it come to these hoes

My hoes like Nelly cause they go Down, down baby
I used to dog chickens, cluck 'em, fuck 'em, and duck 'em

Stuck inside of the game for damn near two decades
And I'ma make you see the insides like a x-ray

The heavy platinum jewelry bling over the white tee
Watch your wifey, she's mostly likely to blow me pipey

Money, murder, steal, kill, rape
You should do like the Internet and start to Bill Gates
This whole world gon' end up with some bad fucking tumors, listening to these Cash Money rumors

Swigger off the Piña Colada
Dreams of having cream and the power

And got grams the size of the head of Gina on Martin
For any discomfort the Ninas is sparking
Be in your apartment, many assault men and semi-revolvers
Keep it clean, I'm a young Sqad street teen, only into green
If you intervene I'll leave your ass colder than Winter
And y'all just look like bitches
You get fucked then I nut up
And just like bitches, I leave you face down and butt up

Cadillac white walls and 'Bauds, pimpin' partna
Plus I can get more work out than a fitness doctor
Let's get this partna, I'm the young don these niggas honor
And those of you who ain't cheap can't buy a vowel

Holla at us, check it Pistols burning
Pop the barrel, turning

We closing any open shop we ain’t concerned in
Coke the size of Sherman Klump we flipped and doubled
And dropped the whip on dubs and dipped in Bubble
Get a bad bitch to hustle and move product
And split them niggas quick as fuck if them dudes try her
Not behind the ho, but only behind the dough
And behind the dough I kill whoever stand behind the door
You ain’t tryna go that route with the Sqad, it’s rough, I promise
We kidnap your mommas and sit our johnsons on her tonsils
We reside inside the S. Q. bombers
And we leave families emotional like Carl Thomas
So stay from ‘round us
And to be honest, ain’t nothing for me to do away with you
I be the same nigga that blow a Tre with you
Then let a K hit you

Take heed to the shit that gleam on the left side of my waist

Some lil’ niggas who seem harmless, but nah bitch

Got a young pretty thing sitting beside me in the whip
With Limo tints to hide me in the whip
Told mami you can keep your clothes on, I wan’ see where your head at
In other words I don’t wanna fuck, I wan’ see where your head at
You can catch me laid back in the cut with ounces and bundles
Bouncing from hustles, doubt me I’ll fuck you, fuck it
Lounging in bubble
Rocky watch resemble mountains or something
Fronting get your body found behind some mountains or sum’n
Aye, when you fuckin’ with me you fuckin’ with cheese
You fuckin’ with Streets, you fuckin’ with heat
You fuckin’ with Sqad, you fuckin’ for free
You touching your knees
And if you hate, you’ll be lucky to breathe
Now how you like lookin’?
When the double gauge is ???? you get your fuckin’ life token
Despite the business, fuck rap
Picture block on a motorcycle wheeling
But the Glock ain’t right for kidneys
I don’t like you bitches, I hate you hoes
Date you hoes, bust nuts in your facials hoes
Then replace you hoes, that’s the type of shit that makes you hoes
All the women in this nation hoes
Hot since my creation woa’

Exploding missile Glock ringing at the front of your door like Jehovah Witness’

The youngest soldier come with it
Cock back, guns put holes in your fitted
Nigga I told you to quit it
I load it with 50

The dro and Henny got me lokin’ and limpin’
Ropin’ up when I drink ‘til I’m over the limit
Hoppin’ out the Rover with Semis
Wildin’ out, go straight to your momma’s house
With a rag on my face with more 9s than dialing out
Now who hating?
Niggas cheapskating, underestimating
The heat take him, put him under extra pavement
Some one week in Jamaica, come back with a accent like - Whoo, whoo, fuck it

Holla at me
Weezy Wee, Raj Smoove
And that’s the end of that story
One
Shit
Man, manNone Look at all the bullshit I been through
If I take you home, will you tell the truth?
Look at all the bullshit I been through
If I take you home, will you tell the truth? Momma take this mothafuckin' block off
Tryna reach you every day, collect calls
Never get through, and I go through withdrawals
Say who told you that I wanted this door
To slam shut, I just wanted to vent or
Ask you if you give me your rent for
A attorney, I can pay you back more
Soon as I get out, yeah, every rack is yours
Commissary running low, I need help
Not too much, I hustle up the rest myself
K. Dot wrote me saying Marcus got killed
If you knew me, then you know how bad I feel
Quisha prove me wrong, and never came to visit
And I heard she fucking on some other nigga
And my niggas left me in the dark, blind
Mama just get back at me this last time Men lie, wo—women lie
Men lie, wo—women
Men lie, wo—women lie
Men lie, wo—women
Look at all the bullshit I been through
If I take you home, will you tell the truth? Mama, take this mothafuckin' block off
That's on the date the day I take the block off
Pulled up, and they put me in them cop cars
Please believe me, this ain't easy by far
You forgot you're talking to your only son
'Member when you put me in that relay run
I was racing, chasing dreams to be the best
You had taught me that the very day I won
All I need is you to give me same support
Investigation saying that the same report
From a witness just might testify in court
DA say I take a deal, or take a loss
I ain't built for all them goddamn numbers
God's will, say a prayer for me mama
If you can't, then open up the phone lines
Mama just get back at me this last time Men lie, wo—women lie
Men lie, wo—women
Men lie, wo—women lie
Men lie, wo—women
Look at all the bullshit I been through
If I take you home, will you tell the truth? Dante, if I stress to take the block off
That's the day the state had take them locks off
I could only help but do so much
Bettering yourself, your own crutch
Look at your reflection, tell me who you see
Who is your protection? G-O-D
No, it's not neglect-ion, I have just accepted
Your fate and what its gon' be
'Member all the nights that I cried
Thinkin' that my only son just died
Peeking through the window, kickin' through the door
It's you they looking for, raid outside
Rather see you locked up than dead
Only you would say that I'm selfish
So before I take the stand and put this bible in my hand
Son, let me say this Men lie, wo—women lie
Men lie, wo—women
Men lie, wo—women lie
Men lie, wo—women
Look at all the bullshit I been through
If I take you home, will you tell the truth?
Esco let's go
Esco let's go, c'mon
Esco let's go, let's go, let's go
Esco let's go, yeah, c'mon I used to drive in a circle before I pulled up
Now I just go up, they know when I got it tucked
Tip the door man, racist neighbors flinching
They don't know if I'ma rob 'em or if I'm Russell Simmons
They thought it was me, just like Mike Bivins
They pray for my downfall like the mom of Robin Givens
Watching how you living
I just wanted to roll B-L-U-N-T, and watch B-E-T
Picture Amerie eating Free
I'm trying to write hood movies, like Posse and Five Heartbeats
I'm all inside a dark room
My incense smoke took the form of ghost and it spoke
It said, Nas, you the best on both coasts, you so big
You should write the word slave
On both sides of ya beards like Prince did
So what's this? Fuck St. Nicholas
You the only ghetto nigga in the hood giving gifts WHAT IT IS!
Esco let's go 
Esco let's go, c'mon
WHAT IT IS! WHAT IT IS!
Esco let's go

Esco let's go, let's go, let's go
WHAT IT IS! WHAT IT IS, NIGGA! Esco let's go, yeah
WHAT IT IS, NIGGA! WHAT IT IS! I jump in the shower, it feel like rain
Everybody wanna be king but can't handle the pain
Used to rap now they all wanna sing
Ask Elizabeth Taylor, when did ice turn to bling
She said, Nas, it 'cause y'all rock tiny diamonds in the biggest chains
You the first nigga in the game that said fuck fame
You the 5th nigga in The Beatles
You the 10th nigga in the Wu-Tang, so nigga let yo' nuts hang
But they can't handle it, I'm scandalous, I'm trifling
That's why I'm wifing 'em, quick to stick a knife in 'em
Catch me thinking, drinking, hurting my health
These women keep trying to unloosen my belt
Trying to get my wealth
I feel like Jesus with doubting Thomas', broken promises
I wanna walk the golden streets like where my mama is
But if I do what y'all want, I'll get a thousand years WHAT IT IS!
Esco let's go 
Esco let's go, c'mon
WHAT IT IS! WHAT IT IS!
Esco let's go 
Esco let's go, c'mon
WHAT IT IS! WHAT IT IS!
Esco let's go, let's go, let's go 
Esco let's go, let's go, let's go
WHAT IT IS! WHAT IT IS, NIGGA! Esco let's go, yeah
WHAT IT IS, NIGGA! WHAT IT IS! Staring at the face of my watch
It's like a crystal ball with the ability to make the issue stall
I told my man duck 'cause I know where the missile fall
'Cause the ice is a fortune teller for the rich and small
Went to my man crib who dead and saw his picture fall
I picked it up his voice whispered, nigga ball
So I smoke the finest, 85 footer ocean liners
I do it for the have nots of mad spots
That resemble screensavers on your laptops
And niggas can't believe it like seeing that nigga Zab drop
I'll be in Cameroon, bandanas on silk Dior
Sip cream liqueur, green and blue Fila velour suits
Boss move, only thing that I endorse duke
Stash houses, gamble, I don't sweat a loss duke
All true and living, God, we was here first
Parisian linen garb and Kashmir shirts WHAT IT IS!
Esco let's go 
Esco let's go, c'mon
WHAT IT IS! WHAT IT IS!
Esco let's go 
Esco let's go, c'mon
WHAT IT IS! WHAT IT IS!
Esco let's go, let's go, let's go 
Esco let's go, let's go, let's go
WHAT IT IS! WHAT IT IS, NIGGA! Esco let's go, yeah
WHAT IT IS, NIGGA! WHAT IT IS!
It’s like I wanna spit something written
But keep forgetting
So I guess it’s from the heart from the start
Played my part
Seemed like I just wasn’t reaching the charts
5000 hours, rewritting Power
Over and over
Some nights sober, some nights gone off the Henny as usual
So unusual to be in this position
Everything I say everybody tryna diss ‘em
Everybody playin him, truth be told
The last nigga ever let the truth be told
And oh Mos Def ran to my home
And said they gon have yo ass gone
Light jokes, you keep playin with them white folks
Can't even take the piss
They gon’ test your urine
Cut all the sponsorship for the touring!
“Where the Dark Fantasy tour at Ye?”
I dont know, ask, ask Hennesy 
Say ‘he ain't clean enough’
But rappers ain't mean enough?
Enough lashes like I ain't seen enough
On the real, this is like the neo-Emmitt Till
Whistling, get yo fuckin' ass killed
Lets keep this shit real!
Now who the realest
Everybody feel this
And everyday of my life, people try to tell me that I hate the whites
Cause I said what's right
I go to sleep and deal wit it every night
And wake up every morning
And walk to the liquor store or coffee store shop on the Mersa whats worser?
Its no verse that would reverse the-
In print or in cursive
They curse the name, or maybe call me Kane
Let's have a ‘toast for the douche bags’
Black people wanna talk about me on blogs
Cause I like clothes like, 'look at this fag'
Thats what I have to deal wit real shit
Yall dont even understand, what it take to be a real man
A black man interested in art, speaking from the heart and playin’ my part
And all this illuminati talk, like my first hit single wasn't ‘Jesus Walks’
For many years, these ain't rhymes these is muthaf-cking tears
They playin’ wit niggas careers
Felt like I’m the only real nigga here
From my last breath
They kicked me out the awards and my nigga Diddy left
Then they even sent Beyoncé up to give the award back
Didn’t even know I afford that
And she rode the wave as I rode the slave
As I felt like a slave as they try to put my shit up in the grave
Nigga behave, nigga behave
Be the first one
I bet ya no one else would ever say nuttin’ and stay frontin’
And get up and just perform, shit is enormous
Shout out to Steve Stout, you know what this shit ’bout
My whole family, now I’m scared of Grammy’s
Cause everybody know that Dark Fantasy was the highest rated album in history
So I just avoided it, not to be exploited, not to be recorded
'Cause I cannot afford it, I cannot afford more shit to be impor-ted
Uh, it’s too real for these niggas, you feel for these niggas
How I feel to be a black man, you say something wrong, nobody understand
Money, power, black, opinion, pick two, they would kill ya No matter what goes on
They may not agree, they may not understand
But God got a plan, to put the mic in my hand
And his hand and that hand
And ideas, and all of theres
And the end, everybody up in here, in this atmosphere
So make it clear, live long and prosper
Much success, even if you wish me the opposite
To quote Nas, I stay on my job
Try to pray to keep my heart from going harm
And I ain't perfect, you know that from old me
My life is real even when I’m in the movies
I’m on the ave, I’m in the cave
I buried my Grandmother on Thursday, two weeks ago
My life is real, as it ever been
To all my friends and even foes
Each and every one of those, let em know
I shine a globe, even in the dark, stay smart
Stay sharp, as a harp played by a musician in this position
Feel blessed to make the whole World listen
And just glisten without even trying
Even when I die, I won't stay dead
And its straight off the head, and its straight out the lungs
Looking fly, fresh, old man, so young
And I’m straight from the slums
And never been above so the ba-bum-ba-bum-bum-pum-pum…
This thing ups, let us all give some
Number one yo, I’m number none, no comparision
And make the whole world aware of it
Brooklyn in the building we take care of it
Peace out to all the Sagittarius
And happy birthday Pisces and Aries too
And this go out to all area crew
And if you come from the seven-eighteen then you just like me
From the present, and the past and the future and beyond
Me and Lupe and Kanye we play the song and get it on
Let's get Sick Wid It baby
Sick Wid it baby, yeahehyeahyeahehyeahhahah
Let's get Sick Wid It baby
Said I'm gonna get so Sick Wid It, yeah
Said I'm gonna get highhhhh I don't need no doctor, I don't need no shrink
All I need is broccoli and a 40-oh to drink
Smokin that broccoli now, takes me out
Smokin that broccoli now, takes me out While I was bullshittin
Bitch tried to hit me upside the head with her shoe
Talin bout, Who the fuck you been doin it to?
Comin home always smellin like tuna fish and brew
I said Bitch, if you don't get up outta my talkin face
I'mma slap you real tough-like
And I can almost rest assure you
That it ain't gon' be no pretty sight, ugh
2-4-7, 3-6 Fin
I pull out my dick and spell my name over the bitch
Shoot the hundred fool, let's play for pink slips, whatchu slammin?
That there shit across the street? That ugly ass gremlin?

Ah-ahem
This something I did
Something I can explain how to
I can't speak for everybody, but, uh
Man... There must be more good women than men, percentage-wise
So her chance of having a husband just minimized
That's why a lot of girls claim they ain't into guys
And mess with other girls part time to improvise
I knew she wasn’t bi, no, I seen it in her eyes
But I'm like any other guy, trying to get in her thighs
She telling me about how black people should enterprise
And I'm like, if you don't get your ass in this ride from Enterprise
That I rented yesterday and gotta have in by 5
With the gas fully filled up like I didn't drive
Told her I had a girl, nah, fuck it, I didn't lie
Told her this rap game is alright, I'm just getting by
She had a lil' weed and we get a lil' high
And I'm looking in her eyes and I'm loving her vibe
Told me back in 95' she fell in love with the Tribe
Boo, back in 92', I was just like you
Please, don't be confused by the ice and jewels
I'm like any other nigga, buy ice to stay cool
Like any other nigga that claim they hate school
And think, yeah, Free's banging but she's no Rachel We ball 'til we fall, hit the mall
After we hit, don't call
We fill your lives with nothing but lies
And I would like to apologize
But you can't stand right here
And tell me everything is going to be alright
'Cause until the day a real man stands up
I'm going to have to improvise Was it something I did wrong? Yeah I know I'm wrong
She's at home alone and I'm always gone
Hate it when she mad but more when she passive
Now she on the internet looking for classes
Out of state though, man that hurt, yo
But I got work though, and I'm at work, yo
And she don't call a lot
And when she do she pouring out her heart
You never listen to me, then the call drop... hmmm
And I promised her everything
Told her when I get a deal I'll get her a wedding ring
But when I got my deal I was back in the ring
Fighting my urges, strip club splurges
Never had money so I felt like a virgin
And I'm trying to break the bank's cherry
Tryin' to see can I afford Canaries
With a Ferrari and a dinner date with Halle Berry
Went from fifty g's to fifteen hundred in a week
Now I'm trying to call, one ring, two rings, seven rings
Eight rings, er mother picked up the phone
Like, She in school and she don't stay here no more
I guess there's more good women than men percentage wise
So her chance of having a husband just minimized
I guess that's why she says she ain't into guys
And focus on school full-time to improvise We ball 'til we fall, hit the mall
After we hit, don't call
We fill your lives with nothing but lies
And I would like to apologize
No no, you can't stand right here
And tell me everything is gonna be alright
'Cause until that real man stands up
I'm going to have to improvise
I’m in the old school with the cocaine guts

Gold Dayton wires, I’m the nigga from the flyer
Getting money ‘til I expire
You better ask these muthafuckas ‘bout me
 I’m in the old school with the cocaine guts
Got the beat turned up
Higher than giraffe pussy at the light, stuck
Slappin’ Mickey Mouse on my way to your bitch house
Be talkin’ hella shit but not with my dick in her mouth
I see my relative in the traffic 
Cuz, you got some work? 
Naw, blood
That’s just some Bay shit, we be saying all kind of thangs
We set trip, but we don’t gangbang
I’m still drunk from last night, but I ain’t whopped
This one of them good hangovers
Hope they don’t throw the book 
At me, lock me up and throw away the key
One more DUI, I’m history
Getting money is my specialty
A stack-and-a-half for a half a P
I’ll give it to you at wholesale, long as you spend your cash with me
Better hope you ain’t the po-pell, the Poncherello, the fuzz
Keep your mouth shut, no detail, don’t throw me under the bus
 I’m in the old school with the cocaine guts

Gold Dayton wires, I’m the nigga from the flyer
Getting money ‘til I expire
You better ask these muthafuckas ‘bout me
 I’m riding clean as fuck, with a Phoenix slut
Past 25 years, you’ve seen what’s up
A hundred cars, hundred broads every year
I can barely hear, my music’s loud and clear
‘Bout to run this little bitch and get up outta here
And if you mad, nigga, I don’t care
I’m living my life like a rap star
Everything I do, muthafuckas say “That’s hard”
You can go Behind the Music like VH1
All the records I sold and all the shit I done
Platinum after platinum—you say what?
All I do is hustle, it ain’t ever been luck
It’s that all-day every day grind
If you owe me, you better pay me on time
And if you fuck with me, you know I stay on point
I count the C-notes, the ones, and I’m saving coins I’m in the old school with the cocaine guts

Gold Dayton wires, I’m the nigga from the flyer
Getting money ‘til I expire
You better ask these muthafuckas ‘bout me
 Block nigga on the ave with a cannonball
Her hand in my drawers, say what up to Shannon, y’all
And we can get it all from Isotol to Propofol
Shit’ll make your heart stop, call it King of Pop
I’m in the drop with the top down, gold wire
Cherry pie in my swish’, all I blow is fire
Loud packs, you could come and get what you desire
White walls with the gold stripe, gold tire
I’m higher than a brick building, yeah, your boy chillin’
And I don’t fuck with broke niggas when I’m dope dealin’
See, I know the feeling, get your paper up
Coke white looking right with the same guts
I got the D-boy ways, I call it ‘89
On the grind, getting mine since ‘89
And baby fine but she really ain’t a nigga kind
I’m from the era and that 40-cal might scare her I’m in the old school with the cocaine guts

Gold Dayton wires, I’m the nigga from the flyer
Getting money ‘til I expire
You better ask these muthafuckas ‘bout me

Shooting till my mother fucking hand fall off
Ya track-stars; the gun shot ran y'all off
I pop like a soda watch the can fall off
I can kill y'all and y'all boss
Shotguns, handguns, louder than a band drum
You fuckin with the drum major, lemme play you the anthem
Bang-bang-bang-bang, call it heavy metal
I say bang bang, bitch, I make you feel every letter
B-A-N-G, B-A-N-G
G-A-N-G, we spray then leave
We play when we, no, we play N-E-

Even my ho 'bout it, and don't doubt it
'Cause we both would be Angelina and Brad'n
Spazzin' and blastlin', blastin' and rat-a-tat-in'
And nah, I don't cook, but like potatoes I mash 'em
I don't give a fuck about your money or your fashion
Shots through the window of your brand new Aston
You get out, try to run, now ya chest where them bullets crashin'
Pine box niggas, no crutches, no casts
No wheelchair, just the two-door long black wagon
Flowers on the side and four wheels to steer
I ain't never scared, and I ain't never care
So fuck what they doing over there, I'm doing it here
You're nothing like me, fuckboy, don't be outlandish
We gorillas in the mist, y'all just some Kung-Fu Pandas
Sweet like Fantas, my blood is the same as Bruce Banner's
Hit record on the cameras, motherfuck all the bullshitting antics
They saying he ain't gotta get a clearance from Wayne, that's a disadvantage
Being broke is a foreign language for me like Spanish
Musically, we direct thrillers, call me John Landis It's the 504 slaughterhouse blood-bath
Little nigga stand tall like a giraffe
One-man gang, animal, cannibal
Eat rappers for dinner, my nickname Hannibal
Guns for days I show you what this cannon do
Hit you, split your mothafucking man in two
I grab the chopper, South Park, that’s how I hold the toy
I aim and crank that bitch like Soulja Boy
I’m in the streets one deep, I can hold my own
And shit, it’s only one seat and I control the throne
Look, bitch, I’m on my crazy ass shit
You see the gun poking out like Sheneneh lips
Watch your lips when talking
Cause I be on grave nigga leaking in your coffin, rest in piss
When I die, let me rest with clips

And your son too - there's nothing I won't do
Unless you was me, how could you judge me?
I was brought up in pain, y'all can't touch me
Police pursued me; chased, cuffed and subdued me
Talked to me rudely; 'cause I'm young rich and I'm black
And living a movie, not living by rules
New rap patrolling the city, follow my crews
Bleek you're still with me, nigga what did I say?

I'd rather have a big bitch cause she pays what she weighs

Lifestyle on camera
Hundred thousand dollar chandelier
They tried to turn me to an animal
But white people think I'm radical
Supermodels think I'm handsome
You might think I'm too aggressive
But really I think I'm too passive
'Til I pull out the chopper, start blastin' 1500, all in singles 
Throw it up, watch it fall and drop
'Round and 'round they go

Mega, you played that boy I just bought a choppa with a scope

So, might wanna protect yourself
All headshots, so the vest no help
Yeah, I was just boolin’, smokin’ dope
I’ma pop this perc just to float
And I keep a bag on me 
Ballin’ like an athlete I remember when they used to laugh at me
Now they want a feature, so I’m taxin’
Pull up on a nigga from the back seat
Turn this fuckin' party to a track meet Catch a opp gun him down, hundred rounds, fifty rounds
Make a move out of town, I was broke, but I'm up now
Bad bitches wanna fuck now, in the trap with my guns out
Niggas fu, baby, I got bills to pay
Bitch, get on your knees, bust all on her face
I go apeshit like the Bathing Ape
Cribs in different states, but no real estate
Feel like Rick Ross, how I'm pushin' weight Feel like Rick Ross, uh
2 guns, make you jump, call 'em Kris Kross
R Kelly with funds, boy, you pissed off

I’ma pop this perc just to float
And I keep a bag on me
Ballin’ like an athlete
“Can you feel it?” I got a plastic medicine container of that Afghani—peep
Brought rolling papers, no chemicals, no bleach
I’m about to be in there, to the point where I’mma blur my speech
After I finish this liter of yak and blow this eighth of kief
Mannish, don’t bother me, I’ll pop ya
With these 5-point-5-6’s, bust your medulla oblongata
That’ll stop ya, bring you up real proper
Spin you around like the propellers on a hiznelicopter
My name ain’t Harry, but I’m a Potter
My mouth hella dry, I need some water
One day I know I’mma die, forgive me Father
But I’m living for now, forget tomorrow
I’m a product of my environment, so I ain’t thinking about retirement
I’mma continue to push this yay, fuck a 401
I fuck on squaws every day, and I get my helmet ate'n
Parole violator, my agent hella be hatin’ “Can you feel it?” I’m high as gasoline off promethazine
And my whole team, we lean in them Cut’ Supremes
I keep a couple things, plus a mask or two
A 40 Glock with a dot in case I have to
I might blast through, chop it up and bounce
My little homie, he be on me, say I owe an ounce
I tell him ‘Catch me in the morning with your bank account
And I’ll just take it off the tab when you cash me out’
I do the mass amount of numbers, I’m impeccable
And I ain’t even gon’ lie, I’m off them edibles
You see, my niggas come through, they buy them vegetables
And out-of-town muthafuckas need their medical
I put the work in, I get them dividends
And them Benjamins become a nigga’s best friend
And everything I’m in, you know it’s off the hinge
It feel good when a real nigga win—say it den “Can you feel it?” “Go on and get your fuck on”—that’s what I told her
I don’t want her triflin’ ass no more, y’all can have my leftovers
I ain’t finna be head over heels over no broad, mayne, I’m too fly
I bait my hook up for another fish to fry
See, when a dude fuck hella broads, he’s a player
But when a broad fuck hella dudes, she’s a slut
And you wanna know what else—you wanna know what? 
I find out that she was fuckin’ on one of the homies, I’m fuckin’ ’em both up
I tell bitches where I’m from to leave their feelings at home
And if they’re listening, they probably ain’t feeling this song
But am I wrong? Standing there looking at me crazy
I’m never fuckin’ you when these other bitches pay me
Already with the baby, come on with them dollars
I’ll show you where they’re going, then them other hoes’ll follow
I’m off in my Impala, 9-fin exact
I just revamped that, put them 10’s in the back “Can you feel it?”The first time, the first time I met Robyn Fenty was 2005. She was shooting a music video at a restaurant called Avacado in Toronto, the song was Pon de Replay, and the director... and the director of the video was Little X. I was introduced to her as the kid who played background music at the restaurant as people ate their dinner. It's hard to believe that eleven years later all three of us would come together the visual for her song called Work. Today the world knows Little X as Director X, they know me as Drake and not the kid singing while you order pasta. But eleven years later, they still know Rihanna as the one and only, Rihanna. Captivating from day one, the iconic being known as Rihanna was already at a place where most artists only dream of going. For them that's often a peak, but for her that was a starting point, as she has kept ascending to an untouchable level ever since. When it comes to music, she relentlessly takes over the charts with every release. When it comes to performances, they swarm in masses just to be in her presence... obviously... And when it comes to fashion and style she makes it seem so effortless until you try to do it yourself, which is when it gets a little awkward. What's most impressive isn't the endless list of stats, awards and accomplishments. What's most impressive is the person. Some artists need to play a character to achieve success, some need to downplay their own natural instincts to blend in. She succeeds by doing something that no one in this industry does, which is being herself. This woman has surpassed all competition while still being the same girl from Barbados, surrounded by the same friends, speaking with the same accent and never missing a crop over unless it's to come and perform at OVO Fest. We love the music which can change styles from album to album. We love the videos which change their artistic vision from year to year. But most of all, we love the woman who hasn't changed since day one. She's someone, she's someone I've been in love with since I was 22 years old. She's one of my... she's one of my best friends in the world. All my adult life I've looked up to her even though she's younger than me. She's a living, breathing legend in our industry. Ladies and gentlemen, the recipient of the Michael Jackson Vanguard Award for 2016: Rihanna.

In the club you get super slum, we crunk like Lil Jon
If you go do the A-Town Stomp, throw your hood up if you ain't no punk
I be ridin' and glidin', whippin' and dippin' 
You can dodge it and hide, trippin' and slippin' 
I be grittin'and grindin',

The watch on my wrist, the diamonds in my ear
The ice on my necklace shine like a chandelier 
I'm a professional sucka-ducka, I'm having my dough 
Where I'm from you ain't gotta join the army to go to war 
The whip that I slide, the shit that I drive
Speakers and  sound like a concert inside 
Candy so wet, look like my car been cryin'
You gotta see it yourself, it's kinda hard for me to describe 
The road that I chose, the path that I took
The bakin' soda, Yola and  that I cooked
The  that I keep just spend most of their time in prison 
Terminal Island, Tallahassee and Saint Quentin

 Hello?
 Whassup girl
 Ain't nothin - this nigga in here stressin
Talkin that old off the wall back to Africa shit again
 What, that God Body shit?
 Yeah, that dumb shit
I'm tryin to get up OUTTA here
 I hear that.. but yo, you know the spot is pumpin tonight
 Word f'real where?
 You know, where the real niggas is poppin the Cristal
Not that White Star!
 Ha hah! Word where the real niggas at? Listen.. to reason
Pretty baby baby listen A young wild beautiful love child
You like them thug style link rocking, then mink copping
Hit you on the sink a hundred dollar drink popping
The head'll make you take 'em shopping, a foul doctrine
Reminiscent of my first time up in a chick
You was innocent, but now you rent-a-dick, wear the tightest shit
Chanel looking real, airbrushed nails
Hit the gym, hit the scales, heaven-sent but negligent 
To see a prophecy, your ebony tone is locking me
The way you moan make me daydream of you on top of me
Wishin I could be the one man; but you juggle
Way too many Willies all in one hand
You wanna run up in clubs, getting rubbed on
Niggas pull your hair, shake your fat rear
Get your fuck on - following week, you back there
But what you stuck on, weed, clowns and cars
Puffing with some lil nigga, husband not knowing she's out
Could you believe Eve, Mother Earth of the seas
Niggas thirst you, you just let 'em hurt you and leave
What up ma, fronting like you naive
Push your man's whip, calling police when you flip
Can't understand it, yo it should be a throne for us
But for now that's a whole different zone from us, word! Diamonds all shining, looking all fine
Pretty little face, get a little high
Young girl struggling, trying to survive 
Mother of the Earth, she made you and I
Just tired of playing the same ol' games
Messing with my mind, emotional thangs 
 Like Isis, you got your heart broke and felt lifeless
Grow up girl instead you want revenge so now you act the nicest
To who'sever getting down and trifless
To get his mind all you do is give him somethin priceless
Cause in time he'll realize the thighs is all he needs
More than weed, then you hit him off with lies and greed 
There you go again, startin wars, making me more yours
Seem to get a kick out of keeping me on all fours
Face glistening, I'm addicted to you
Original, Wisdom Body got me picturing you
Igloos of ice tricking on you, you never listen
To this nigga spending Franklins on tennis anklets
Must've had a bad deal in the past though
Can't even keep it real with a nigga with cash flow
Say men are all the same, what we need to do is break this chain
You got a job part-time and school's your night thing
With dreams to settle down, it ain't far from now
You getting interviewed, but your boss is into getting screwed
Typical day that the black girl sees
Coming home wanting more from a college degree Diamonds all shining, looking all fine
Pretty little face, get a little high
Young girl struggling, trying to survive 
Mother of the Earth, she made you and I
Just tired of playing the same ol' games
Messing with my mind, emotional thangs 
 Where are you focused, on legit niggas and where the coke is
Nice and Thug Life niggas, yo you seem hopeless
Your value - too much to be measured, I wonder how you
Could ever be played, your pussy worth gold amounting to
More than the world, but not knowing nothing about you
You leaving the crib, taking all your kids out to
Drop them off, letting some nigga knock you off
So hot and soft, that's the same thing that got you lost 
Growing up seeing it, it should remind you, you bein lied to
Everything that move be inside you
Sacred as you are, left with these wannabes to guide you
I watched you, hard to knock you, I tried not to
They spot you out dancing topless in your drawers
Damn look, there goes a black girl lost You should be ashamed of yourself
The way you carry yourself
The way you hang out all night long
Doing silly things that is wrong
Black girl lost
Nard & B

Get you outta here in hurry if I must

Caz wakey without the brush no Murrays
Power player no bench press just burpies
Eating pistachios cleaning my AKs smoking me weed and bumping me regain

The best thing I want y’all to do for me is pray
That I make it home and get back safely one day
I’m a for real life hussla I sit on the fucking case

Money up no sleep
Head back nosebleeds

Any way my team on dream all you wanna be
Halloween Jamie Lee Curtis, Jackson came 50
Icing on this mic all strong on this bike
Pedal to the metal  gear solid you just all hype No pencil or paper banker only kind a live with
Doctor, chopper, bed surgeon if we think he feel right
Having no money concussion leave ya head hurt
Good community I rest in peace like a dead person
Crib look like a mansion compared to your house
Focus on money you focus on me like what ya all about
She’s back woods type I live in a log house
Yea I been to your house sperming ya broads up
Ain't even going lie she showed me a dope time
Paper view, showtime, charged her like my phone died
Entourage clothes line homies stay on your grind
Could be where I was at 2 years ago with no time
Backwards feeling it we dark silhouette
My name nicotine and cane but nah I don’t smoke cigarettes
But I smoke niggas I’m addicted to gettinf them bitches wet
I got a joke for ya money ya all don’t get it yet 
I got some gidname for the bridnain, gas, 91 octane
They say ’40, you’ve been doin’ it for years, how you maintidnain?’
In a region where people supposed to fail
Living in the Bay with the sharks and killer whales 
I tell ‘em ‘I’m grown, not with the bitchness’
I’m too crispy and polished, I stay solid, I mind business
I don’t hate on brothers, I take my hat off to hustlers
And what I want for myself, bruh, I want for others
Republicans wear red, and Democratics wear blue
Politicians be bangin’ and set-trippin’ like me and you
It’s OK to have nice things, but don’t let them things have you
That’s what my OG told me and my whole crew
In the heart of the slums I hung with the bums
Soaked up game, like a sponge
Back then, insufficient funds
So I started slangin’ gook, pocket full of hunds
BIATCH! Whole stack full of hun’eds, got that bag on me
When I got that bag, know them bands on me
When I got that bag, know them bands on me
When I got that bag, know them bands on me From the kiddie walk to Blackhawk, in a guarded gated community
No streetlights or sirens, in the land of the opportunity
Rubbing my shoulder with the white folks
In the beginning, it was so new to me
Tycoons and golf carts
Came a long way from grinding up on the block
Life savings all in my socks
Mouth full of spitters, swallowing rocks
Me and my niggas and gritters posted up with chops
Bagging up zippers, microwaves and pots
I need to duplicate myself but I cain’t ‘cause I’m one of one
Let’s go one-on-one, potna, put down the gun
I pull strings like a banjo
I could have some niggas run up in your bando
My muscle car souped up and I ain’t talkin’ ‘bout Campbell
I’m thinkin’ ‘bout buying a Bentley truck and a lambo
I dress like a king and I’m out here living a dream
If you put your mind to it you could do anything Tryin' to put something together, having my gouda and my cheddar
Foldin’ it backward like an omelet, ‘bout to get higher than I can measure
Got that plug like a Tesla, your bitch, you might wanna check her
She slick and she freaky sneaky, she want me up in her kidney
She want me to suck her titty, she wanna sit on my lap
Your bitch doin’ too fuckin’ much, I ain’t fuckin’ with none of that
I’m too busy, I’m in a rush, in the traffic checking my traps
On my way to the studio, laughin’, rappin’, making slaps
Only saps I fuck with is the SAP Center
Where the Sharks swim, surrender
Don’t test us, we got a short temper
Fuck around and chop you down like timber
BIATCH! 
Hah, hah, hah, hah, yeah, yeah
What it is player?
(You player, it's all about you
How you gon' say that man)
If I had your hand I'd turn mine in

Hah man, you know man, I'm just dealing that hoe money
You know hoe money is slow money but it's sho' money
(Check this out man, you run up on your bitches
This is what you tell 'em
Stick they hands in they panties, grab that knot
Stick they arm in a car window, drop it like it's hot) Uhh, I talk jewels and spit diamonds: all cherry
Like a hymen, when I'm rhyming with remarkable timing
Caviar and silk dreams, my voice is linen
Spitting venom up in the minds of young women
Mink thoughts to think thoughts type similar
Might you remember, my shit is cold like December
Smoother than Persian rugs, the cashmere
Chromosomes make a nigga Jigga - Jay-Z, lethal drugs
18-carat gold pen, when it hits the sheets
Words worth a million like I'm rapping them through platinum teeth
I got the Grey Poupon, you been warned
'Cause all beef return well done filet mignon
The Don, smell of Dom on my breath as I
Yawn,  when you hoes try to con a pro
As if you didn't know, Jay's about getting dough
Spitting flow like fine wines down your earlobe
I'm smooth but deadly like a pearl handled pistol
Honeys hum in melody when I rub it like crystal
The proper etiquette, when I drop the subject verb
Then the predicate, with this rich nigga rhetoric
I'm solid gold, I rap like a mink stole
I stick pearl tongues your world'll never know
From New York to Paris, the vocal style vary
From nice to deadly like a bad bag of D, Now
Notice the child swift like a Lotus
Focus on the loc' I be the greatest nigga that wrote it
Return of the Jedi, from Rio De Janeiro on the red eye
Yet I still feel the need to be fly
I did die when I'm rapping then slide like satin
You know the black I white china in the brain cabinet
I never cry if I did I'd cry ice
From my nigga Sauce, I hit you with this advice
Life's short, so play hard and stick hard
And the only time you love them is when your dick hard Whoooh! 
Nah, you know, that's just laid back man

In due time
Everybody gotta shine
Get yours, I spray nines
I say this one time
The last time, I swear to y'all
I'm from where
The dope fiends is at
And killers crawl
And snitches call police
On these niggas, and street
Corners everybody's like
Smokin' marijuana and
Snuffin' niggas in faces and startin' drama and
Shootin' niggas, cold blood, just kill 'em, so what
With the fo' pound go nuts
Better slow up
Before you get your ass sewn up
Nigga never gon' grow up
Drinkin' the Henny
But he know he gon' throw up
Tryin' to make crack sales
What it look like? Future for a black male
Don't want to make my momma cry
On a front page for a homicide
Fly whips, all I wanted to drive
Where chicks get blunted and ride
Do 105 in the fast lane
And a fast pace, chasin' the papes
Spendin' chips on big chains
And the dimes that give brains
That was a 80's and 90's thing
Now I'm into big things Nah, I ain't fuckin' with you
Now I'm into big things
Gotta get my life together man
'Cause now I'm into big things
Nah, I ain't gon' ride with you
'Cause now I'm into big things
Nah, I can't do that shit no more
Now I'm into big things
Nah, I can't fuck with you
I'm into big things
Nah, I ain't gon' stand on no corners
I'm into big things
Tired of talkin' small talk
I'm into big things
I'm into big things
The big things
The big things When I started this
All I wanted was cars and cribs
Like other rap artists but
Do I know where I'm goin' to?
Can I forget when I came from?
I be showin' you
Another style I'ma flow for you
Can I make somethin' wild
I can throw for you, flow for you
Make it bi-coastal
Take it to heights
That some of y'all can't come close to?
Some of y'all
Want to talk like hoes
Worse than bitches
And when y'all niggas see me blow
Bet it hurt like stitches
No competition
I stop and twist 'em
Hit 'em like a mafia proposition
I rap and y'all stop and listen
Thinkin' back to when I had not pot to piss in
Look up at a nigga, now
Rocks that glisten
Can't stop my mission
Make another LP drop
I'm hittin' with the new shit, exclusive
No time to get caught up in a crime
I ain't have shit to do with
Used to chase the hoes
Now I chase the dough
Is y'all bitches gonna help me get paper?
No! Nah, I ain't fuckin' with you
Now I'm into big things 
Gotta get my life together man 
'Cause now I'm into big things 
Nah, I ain't gon' ride with you 
'Cause now I'm into big things 
You know I can't do that shit no more 
Now I'm into big things
Nah, I can't fuck with you 
I'm into big things
Nah, I ain't gon' stand on no corners 
I'm into big things 
Tired of talkin' small talk
I'm into big things
I'm into big things
The big things
The big things I go past y'all 
Y'all got the glass jaw 
And when I hit it, admit it
Y'all on ya ass y'all 
We on the same team
You don't wanna pass the ball
Chuck and gunnin' for dough
You want to score
But you really don't know how to to ball
I put you on
It was me that introduced you to wealth
Crossin' me is like shootin' yourself
Wanna blow so fast, now do it yourself
You ain't shit now
You was so ill, why you never came out?
Where ya clique now?
Where you sit now? In the back seat
Mad 'cause I flip styles and I pack heat
Make you run laps like a pro athlete
And I done that
From my experiences
I appear relentless
Take more time
Just to hear my sentence
I'ma tell you what's real
And what could stop you from makin a mil'
You could prevent this
When niggas don't see eye to eye to you
Lie to you
Wanna get high with you
Want to eat food off of your labor
And take food off your table
'Cause they don't see your vision
Don't understand your mission
Is to make history
While you here
How long you plan on livin'?
Not for forever
At least to 140
Pray for me, I'm tryin' to eat
Like the niggas who bought
Motown off Berry Gordy
Good God Nigga I'm tired of games
I'm into big things
Gotta get my life together man
'Cause now I'm into big things
Tired of talkin' small talk
'Cause now I'm into big things
I'm into big things
The big things
The big things
Man we already did that
Now I'm into big things
No time to get sidetracked
Now I'm into big things
Get money now besides that
Some more big things
I'm into big things
The big things
The big thingsNone
Diplomatic immunity, fuck 'em
All that peace and that unity
All that weak shit'll ruin me, fuck 'em, yeah
'Cause niggas started talkin' to me like I'm slowin' down
Opinions over statistics, of course
Gassed off journalistic
Come at me and all you'll get is the ballistic report
Booked a private room at Wally's, waiter twistin' the cork
I got multi-colored rings like the Olympics, of course
At award shows, cuttin' through the tension, of course
Girls huggin' me then askin' me, What scent that is, boy?
I be walkin' around the Six like I invented it, boy
Yeah, who am I? The do or die
The one with the fewest lies and the truest ties
They try to compare us, but
Like a job straight outta high school there's no you and I
I taught you everything you know, now you got student pride
All factual, I call the house the embassy
The studio the chapel, I hate to travel
I just pulled up on Solána show, the girl's a natural
I knew her way back when Hollywood was international
Yeah, the furthest I've been, that's word to my ends
Word to the flags that belong in the hood of my Benz
Very presidential, I broke all the codes for zonin' in my residential
I broke spirits that I never meant to
My body isn't much of a sacred temple, with vodka and wine
And sleep at the opposite times
Promise shit is gettin' outta line like when you make a stencil
Or gettin' outta line like when you break a pencil
Violatin' the Treaty of Versailles
Champagne is the alias, but no cease and desist in I
I refuse to comply with regulations
I listen to heavy metal for meditation, no silence
Like Sanders on the Detroit Lions
Get a run around and I'll bury you where they won't find ya
Motor City Casino, I'm at the cage with my old license
They tell me don't worry, I got your money like Osirus

Dirty 30, workin' on me
Tired of women that may tag me in pictures airin' my dirty laundry
Catering is from Giorgio Baldi, Robyn's favorite
Shit is nice, but I prefer Madeo
Calamari rings and tomato
I got the sauce and now shorties keep claimin' preggo
Wakin' up at 6 PM like, Where does the day go?
Forecastin' tornadoes, brainstormin' retaliation at dinner tables
2010 was when I lost my halo
2017 I lost a J. Lo
A Rotterdam trip had me on front page though
I had to lay low, Hot Topic like your everyday clothes
Closed off but I could never stay closed
Billboard awards, I claimed 13 out in Vegas like Sureños
Black excellence, but I guess when it comes to me it's not the same though, all goodie
That just pushed me to do the things we all couldn't
Niggas stakin' out the crib, it's all gravy
Protection that God gave me
Shit is complex like short niggas 'round tall ladies
I gotta watch who I'm talkin' to like it's all-ages
I've seen buddin' careers turn to sit around and talk about other careers, judgin' their peers
Knowledge from niggas who did not contribute to none of this here
Cover my ears, my security government tier
Yeah, advance the venue so we know the exits
Check the guest list
If opps make an appearance at least it's expected
Tell 'em I don't wanna link like a broken necklace
I'll be in better company with my own reflection
Mirror, mirror, on the ceiling of my suite in the Royal Palace
The TV playin' Al Jazeera
Inshallah, I hope the mission keeps on gettin' clearer
Whenever, wherever, OVO will always be together like Shakira I love, I love
I love, I love it
Baby, IWho else really try to mess with Hollywood Cole
Treating Birmingham like my Hollywood shows
I'm tryin' to tell you something that you prolly should know
This that slumdog millionaire Bollywood flow
And ahh, my real friends never hearing from me
Fake friends write the wrong answers on the mirror for me
That's why I pick and choose
I don't get shit confused
I'm not with different crews
We walk the same paths, but got on different shoes
We live in the same building, but we got different views
I got a couple cars, I never get to lose
Don't like my women single, I like my chicks in twos
And these days all the girls is down to roll
We hit the strip club, and all them girls find a pole
Tell your girl to tell her friend that it's time to go
Tell me today's weather
I know they say they good but trust me I'm better
I sound like the coldest Miami night ever
I'm cold but still hot you can't decide on a sweater
Really this whatever and I am murdering and this is so amusing
If there's a sight to see I am an illusion
I tell you I'm the man baby, what is the confusion
And if they still sleeping on me someone hit the snooze then
Keep sleeping while I sell a couple million
I'm headed for the moon, I ain't bout to hit the ceiling
I'm about to hit the club, women tell me I'm appealing
But fuck what they say, let me tell you how I'm feeling
I'm drinking, these London street lamps got a real glow
Drizzy playin' driving fast but it feels slow
And ask your man, he's a hater baby he don't know
I could kick a punt and turn that shit into a field goal
This here was meant to get buried
I got a lot of things, I mention those barely
I ain't lyin' to the kids, like the dentist ain't scary
I'm what Lebron was to St. Vincent-St. Mary's
But I ain't playin' high school games
Pulling McClarens through a McDonald's drive through lane
I'm too fly, keep it hip-hop like Afu Ra
Girl on that McClaren, you gotta lift the doors
Blades chopping through the city streets, liquid swords
It was all a dream Last night I had a dream, thoughts was racin through my head
Felt so real to me, this is what was said Had a dream, I said; Bout who? he said
'Bout B.I.G., I said; That's big, he said
Dig what he said; Proceed, he said
Indeed, I said, so, breathe I did
Don't repeat what I say, I said, he said nothing
He agreed with his head, he just nodded like this
What I believe to be a yes, I repeated what was said
It came to me like a whisper last evening, I said
What's the deal, playboy? was the greeting he said
First thing I wanted to know was the reason he was dead
Mo' Money Mo' Problems,' better believe it, he said
Careful what you wish for, you might receive it, he said
I see, I said, jealousy I said
Got the whole industry mad at me, I said
Then B.I. said, Hov, remind yourself:
Nobody built like you, you designed yourself!
I agree, I said, my one of a kind self
Getting stoned every day like Jesus did
What he said, I said, has been said before
Just keep doin your thing, he said; say no more Was it all a dream - tell me
Was it all a dream, was it a dream
Was it all a dre-eeee-eeeee-eeam
I gotta know 
Was it all a dream - was it a dream
Was it all a dream, a dream
Was it all a dre-eeee-eeeee-eeam It was all a dream, I used to read Word Up! magazine
Salt-n-Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine
Hanging pictures on my wall
Every Saturday, Rap Attack, Mr. Magic, Marley Marl
I let my tape rock 'til my tape popped
Smoking weed and bamboo, sipping on private stock
Way back, when I had the red and black lumberjack
With the hat to match
Remember Rapping Duke, duh-ha, duh-ha
You never thought that hip-hop would take it this far
Now I'm in the limelight 'cause I rhyme tight
Time to get paid, blow up like the 
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner
Peace to Ron G, Brucey B, Kid Capri
Funkmaster Flex, Lovebug Starsky
I'm blowing up like you thought I would
Call the crib, same number same hood, it's all good
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga Was it all a dream - tell me
Was it all a dream, was it a dream
Was it all a dre-eeee-eeeee-eeam
I gotta know 
Was it all a dream - was it a dream
Was it all a dream, a dream
Was it all a dre-eeee-eeeee-eeam I see, I said, jealousy I said
Got the whole industry mad at me, I said
Then B.I. said, Hov, remind yourself:
Nobody built like you, you designed yourself!
I agree, I said, my one of a kind self
Getting stoned every day like Jesus did
What he said, I said, has been said before
Just keep doin your thing, he said; say no more We about to change this game here
Check my pockets ain't nothing but game there
I remain without fear
Keep the lames clear, and the cats that's all about scrap remain here
On top of this Metropolis
My name is like a square
Dropped off every tier
Now y'all can swear to Jay
Heard it the other day
Through the mystery, we get it swiftly
We got to hit you every night before we hit the lights it's type addictive
Need cash to live with, the beat goes on
Everyday is a hustle, the heat grows on
Funny thing happen, in the midst of chasing money and foes
And the worst thing worst than getting old is not getting old
Niggas stay low, like six-fours of shit and gold
And watch the hoes with form fitting clothes
And I hope they shine
Seen a lot of things and enough memories to last me two lifetimes
Can't knock the hustle I'm taking out this time
To give you a piece of my mind
Who do you think you are
Baby one day you'll be a star Check this
In a mans world need a girl to tough something
Pull an 80 out her Anne Klein purse and bust something
If you skating through the night to the light, then trust something
When I get home
Then it's on
Girl just crack those shaped legs like Grade A eggs
Love the way you behave and beg
Moan, turn those hollers to screams as we zone like a college team
Then they can hear you from Hollis, Queens 
Life with me, consists of a lot of things
Chicks in your ear hit the dirt cause you got hotter things
But you know how to scream, friends talking dizziness
Remind them freak chicks to stay out my business
You know they can't love it, trips to LA with no luggage
Came back with six bags struggling
In first class if my ass should crash, champagne spilled on me
Bank still off on me But until the last day, I'm the one who's crazy
Cause that's the way you making me feel 
I don't want no romance, I just want the chance
Can't knock the hustle for real Ever since you retired, working alongside of live wires
In this rap biz with fake nigs, you know liars
I guess I'm biased, what I talk about I live
These rap dudes can flip, but some of them ain't even rapping for chips
What part of the game is this?
Seems brainless, on tours like whores guess what I'm saying I meant
Cats that go all out for their gold plaques
Started with four jacks, ended up with Gold Ac's
Bet your lungs collapse if my funds get trapped
On the weight of me through you, screw you
Gun blew you, out of one then two shoes
Run through you like UH, EXCUSE YOU!
But that's my cash, I understand you hustle
That's my cash, you don't understand
Let my dough pass, you can show it love
Like a rap star in front of the club
But don't knock the hustle 
Lemme 'splain the difference 'tween you and I
Hot in Miami but you know I keep the coolest ride
Stop like yeah ragged rockin' 
Pullin' up on the side is a suicide
Aye, you just a run-of-the-mill nigga
Here's the difference man I run with the mills, niggas can't eat I ain't done with the meal
See dem niggas that's grinnin' man they have fun with da steel
Pharrell, you a cool nigga. Let me shake your hand. You wear tight pants, you wear black bands, you wear long Vans, crib in the sky and
I heard you got a crib in Virginia, on the sand.
Not you, you ain't a Robb Report nigga
Nigga, yous a perjuror, you lie in court nigga
You prolly snitchhy snitchy and proly bitchy bitchy
I don't wear them big chains no mo' because they itch me
Drop my girl off, pick up the enzo
Ridin' through Hileah, ride through Kendall
Ride through Carol City, ride through Overtown
Where they leave dat ass on the ground
But you say that they know you now
But the difference is when dey see ya, will they hold ya down
See P grew up with a heroine pedal?
They made fun of me cause I was a odd fellow
See I was half skate park I was half ghetto
But you cut me open then u seen my bones made of metal
Here's my DNA yes it was essential
Unlike your aftermarket Roley Presidential
Look at my Audemars, three hundred something
Barack inspired  the black one comin' Pu-Pull up in that new thang all mellow

We eatin' over here why would I miss meals?
Whisper in her ear give her thigh lip chills
Young moolah yeah I know you like dat baby
And she wanna be in the mix like a white-black baby
Weezy a.k.a. which one of ya'll girls want me
High-definition tv in the front seat

And they say money talk. Can you say how I'm doin? I'm doin' real fine I'm doin' real fine
It took a lil' time it was just a hill climb
And now we at the top so let's pose for the pictures
Cause our money longer than the nose of da bitches?
And, and for my shows do ya know what I'm gettin'?
Like a mansion every night it's fair to say I make a livin'
And hip hop never closed it just wasn't safe to visit
But I reopened it I'm bout to break the ribbon
I see it and I'm in it I do it how you dreamt it
Ice game dumber than O.J. Simpson
I ride next year check the numbers on the temps and
Hotta than a bitch check the numbers on my temp and ya boyfriend a bitch watch I treat him like a wimp and
We are all apes I remember when we were chimps and man, you can bet I'm gon' be limpin

Crime, life, bitches, money
Time..
For my Braveheart's.. my Braveheart's
Uhh, uhh, uhh.. what, what, what?
One time.. two times.. From Breaking Atoms to Illmatic, to goin platinum
Shit did change course since rippin it with Main Source
Nine-one, nine-two, time flew
Out of the blue, time for a new young king to rule
Younger frame, older state of mind
Find my name on a page in your Qu'ran, I learned that, in '89
When I was slingin cocaine and baby 9's
Put it in rap and I gave y'all a way to rhyme
God guides us, from public assistance to high rises
Condos, houses where y'all can't find us
Move on your cliques in silence, and wet it up
My meal everyday was a slice and 7-Up
Took advice from a street legend
Identities have been changed, to protect the innocent
Witnessin niggas mistakes, visits at niggas wakes
Cause jealousy infiltrates and seals your fate Look way deep inside yourself
Discover the diamond inside, find ya wealth
Once you get it, you gotta live it the limit
Niggas never wanna see you with it, FUCK THEM THO'
Niggas can't come close enough to touch the dough
The lifestyle I live is untouchable
So we clutch a few, guns that'll touch your crew
Cause we learned to do what the hustlers do Different ways to come out the hood - in cuffs or a casket
Or crazy, or shootin three pointer baskets
Or maybe - it's the rap shit, all type of tactics
We use to get dough, some choose kickin in doors
I asked a reverand, my mother and a best friend
Less than ten years ago for me to get dough
What y'all recommend is either dope weed or blow
Cause high school was slow, and jewelry was hot
Duckin truancy cops, trains I hopped, to make it downtown
Cisco in my veins, pissed between trains
Canal Street, just lookin at rings
Outside through a glass, went in the store and asked
How much it cost, Korean man brushin me off
For some other big time customer, probably a hustler
Who looked down at my small chain and chuckled up
I said, I'll be just like you soon, motherfucker what? Look way deep inside yourself
Discover the diamond inside, find ya wealth
Once you get it, you gotta live it the limit
Niggas never wanna see you with it, FUCK THEM THO'
Niggas can't come close enough to touch the dough
The lifestyle I live is untouchable
So we clutch a few, guns that'll touch your crew
Cause we learned to do what the hustlers do To them niggas who get life and throw a smile at the judge
Wildest thugs, who blow trial, exiled from the hood
Keepin bitches, comin through on visits
You will survive, them weak freaks think you finished
You first time in you known for poppin your toast
By your third year in you forgotten by most
Niggas wife cut them out of they life, niggas don't write
Friends actin like they don't be gettin your kites
It be ill, niggas coming home and no time, they get killed
Not even home a month and they get peeled, backwards
In they own backyard or in the park
One to the head, two to the heart, you should be smart
In the projects, who gon' die next?
Hoodrats know who let the gats blow and who keep cashflow
Like the niggas know the rats, with some good asshole
Blunts be a good-ass roll while passin your 'dro Look way deep inside yourself
Discover the diamond inside, find ya wealth
Once you get it, you gotta live it the limit
Niggas never wanna see you with it, FUCK THEM THO'
Niggas can't come close enough to touch the dough
The lifestyle I live is untouchable
So we clutch a few, guns that'll touch your crew
Cause we learned to do what the hustlers do Feel me?
One time, huh, two times, uhh uhh uhh
What what what? Uhh uhh uhh..Got to be, got to be, got to be, got to be, got to be Everything I know

The streets done taught me everything I know
The streets done taught me everything—I know With my back against the wall ain't no pressure 
When the beef is really on, ain’t no texting
Pull up real slow in a taxi
Gunshots turn em into athletes
I was hungry for a mil I gotta have it
Drove a couple couple cars up the mansion 
Smoked a whole seven sitting in the traffic
And niggas couldn't beat me if they practiced
Used to use my safe for a mattress
Used to use my mattress for a safe
See I could count a hundred thousand backwards 
And I'm just tryna get it every day
They feigning for the trappers and the rappers
They feigning for the trappers and the rappers
They feigning for the trappers and the rappers
And now I'm all of that, shawty what’s happenin' The streets done taught me everything I know
The streets done taught me everything

The streets done taught me everything—I know Everything I know
Used to hustle at the store 
Used to get it with my bros 
Used to bet on tenfold 
Now I'm all around the coast 
I be all up on the boat 
I be smokin' on that gas 
It might make them bitches choke 
Old school with the rallies 
Used to meet them up at rallies 
So it’s fuck your P 
The streets have taught me how to get it  The streets have taught me everything I know
The streets have taught me everything I know

Still I came through it; clap for him!
But I’m the blueprint, I'm like the map for 'em
I dropped another classic, made Puff pass it
Nobody could touch Puff back when Puff had it
Wayne scorchin', I'll applaud him
If he keep going, pass the torch to him
50 came through like hurricanes do
I thought I'd finish his ass at Summer Jam too
I had the Illmatic on bootleg
The shit was so ahead, thought we was all dead

What up, Jeezy? What it do?
Y’all remind me of us in early '92
Outkast landed, 3 thou was ill
Like a male version of Lauryn Hill
Mobb Deep shook it, but Prodigy took it
A lil' too far, can't fuck with Brooklyn
Wu-Tang gang-banged it, Meth ate
Rae took on the date with the Purple Tape
Passed on to Ason and then Ghostface
They had a hell of a run, standing ovate, ayyy Every day a star is born

Every day a star is born
Clap for 'em! Clap for 'em! Clap for 'em! Hey And I am one of one

Clap for 'em! Clap for 'em! Clap for 'em! Hey
Every day a star is born

Clap for 'em! Clap for 'em! Clap for 'em! Hey And could I be a star?
Does fame in this game have to change who you are?
Or could I be the same one who came from a far away life
Just to make it in these Broadway lights?
Now I'm shining in the broad day light, go figure
A slow transition from a little broke nigga from the Ville
Got a deal, a real life saver
Dreams of being behind the wheel, like Jada
I chill now, cop a little ice later
Cole, you got the glow like a lil' lightsaber
So clap for him! Then applaud Hov, he gave him a platform
Flow so sick thought he wrote the rap for him
No sir, the flow's cold as the shoulders
Of gold digging hoes when a broke nigga approaches
Told you I’m focused, man
I’ll let you motherfuckers soak it in and clap for 'em! Every day a star is born

Hey, hey, and clap for 'em! 
Hey, hey, and clap for 'em!
Clap for 'em! Clap for 'em!

Mothafuck award shows and mothafuck the press like that Mothafuck the rest

It'd be a cold day in Hell, icicles made of sweat
One finger, slidin' 'cross my neck
Niggas know what that mean like they deaf

Sitting pretty in the game, in the city that I claim Yo, the city is mine  
T-O-R-O-N-T-O

Tryna be generous, so honey here's a tip
Now-a-days it's gettin cheaper to put 20's on the whip
So if you a opportunist look for 20's in the clip
And if you find 'em attractive and funny, that's when you dip, dip
And it's a trip, my city broke into sections
Up North I got me a couple of troubles, couple connections
And it's nothing that I created on purpose
There's people that gotta problem
But they scared to let it surface, uh
Ya boy say this, that, and the third to 'em
See me out and they never utter a word to 'em
Expect me not to draw a card from the deck
Anybody in my city going hard I respect but
You got a debt and you choose not to pay that
I'mma hop ya fence, come into your yard and collect, lect uh
It ain't a problem of concern bruh
I always end up with exactly what I earn bruh
This ain't last year, money like a cashier
So hand your receipt if you tryna make a return bruh
Yessir, I live in a city where a lot of people don't get shine, shine
And, I be on by the fence as soon as anybody stepping out of line, line

And we gon' get it like
Chitty, chitty, bang, bang , whoa-oh! I made a detour out of the game when I was hustlin' crack
Made a couple of dollars, made a little bit of change, never looked back
You could find me at the shooter range, practicing bussin' gats
Or in the vocal booth, in this new studio, bussin' raps
With some gold on my body, out my body, off Carlos Rossi
I'm sloppy, I treat my luxury scraper like a Bugatti
La di da di, she like to party off molly, Bacardi
Love to get naughty, a hottie, up in the lobby, she stopped me
She said 40 Water, where you 'bout to be?
I said Follow me, follow me, follow me, bitch, room 223
You got to pay me or pay me no attention, that's how it be
When you born and raised in the V, Northern Cali, Silicon Valley Paid nigga, yeah, I make it happen, turnin' up, ratchet
Thick chick under my arm make your chick look average
Thick bitch, yeah, a big ol' ass, poke it like a cactus
And she got a face that belongs up in a beauty pageant
It's ya boy, Juicy J, trippy, I got realer pimps
Balling hard everyday, ratchet bitches can't resist
I stay laughing to the bank but my dough ain't funny
I run out of rap before I run out of money
When I pop a pill, that's foreplay
Now I'm all in her face like Olay
I'm like okay, I kill the pussy like OJ
When I'm finished with ya woman, she gon' think we soulmates You wanna be around the winners? 
Say you only had a few niggas? 
Girl, I'm just being honest 
I know what you want and he's not it 
I'm off the shits and I'm wit' it 
They can't stop us, we gon' get it 
I'm just being honest 
I know what she want and he's not it
That's why-- Unruly, unruly, maddas
Who keeps bring dubs I've heard too many
Unruly we done you off already
Sound dead for real, I might just say how I feel
Yeah, sounds dead for real, I might just say how I feel
I heard that Tinie Tempah dem are big fans

Uh, I see everybody wanna play gansta now, huh
Well you know what niggas
I'mma just play Kendrick
You gotta respect it
Feel this
Uh, lemme shit on these niggas man Look homie I'm not your crip or your blood
Homie I'm just Kendrick
See me other than him might plead the fifth amendment
Hard headed nigga shit all it take is an instant
Shocked to have scored just as soft as an infant
Say you bust your gun, but never totin' it
You say your man is dope I think he's smoking it homie
Why you provoking it don't mean to boast a bit
But you can call me a fly cause your boy be on some shit
Pussy fly so all the girlies think I'm the shit
I've got it to spend but still never buy them shit
You better guard your bitch
‘Cause all it takes is a finger to turn her on holmes
Something like a lightswitch
Hands down but still dark think I might switch the Jag for the Porsche
‘Cause it got a better steering grip
Young but been a man and you won't understand
Spree wheels looking like a bed room ceiling fan When the beef start cooking
And the shots start coming
Don't hesitate to pop that thing
People start looking
And people start running
Don't hesitate to pop that thing
Rolling down Rosecrans
I fear no man
I be God damned
If I live on my knees I rather die on my feet
That hub city threat shit is me  I'm from the land where fiends fly like Peter Pan
And the average man got a heat up in his dickie pants
I got some plans, to stack riches
Own 76′s like a Philadelphian
You don't know but now I'm focused like camera lens
And if I know your mans I might give a second chance
‘Cause I don't wanna hurt you
Have ‘em running in herzels
Shells stick to his back like a ninja turtle
Crack sells, drug sell all in the virtue
Been an artist since Prince played in Color Purple
Weed smoke hydro blow on that purple
2 straps on my side like suspenders on Urkel
I suspend they murk you, what you lying for?
You know you ain't eating like feed the children commercials
Man my children circle around your block
Let out shots and be home 30 minutes before they curfew When the beef start cooking
And the shots start coming
Don't hesitate to pop that thing
People start looking
And people start running
Don't hesitate to pop that thing
Rolling down Rosecrans
I fear no man
I be God damned
If I live on my knees I rather die on my feet
That hub city threat shit is me It's real
Kendrick
See me in the streets man
Come to me as a man, man
It's real nigga
Kendrick
You gotta respect it
Niggas respect me man 
Stop being some yank nigga

Lotta niggas tryna play gangsta, huh
It's 2004 man
You up in this shit quit it
Be yourself man
Still affiliated
Niggas respect me, bitchNone
Uh, word
You dont get this everyday word With so much drama, in QBC it's kinda hard bein Escobaro
Eldorado red sippin Don out the bottle
My lifes like a Donald Goines novel,
We wave glasses like bravo Drunk niggas with mad problems
Shot pockets niggas on the block rock this
Buy cocaine cook it and chop it, lookin to profit
In triple ways goin through this difficult stage called life
With each year my physicals praised,
Niggas slip beyond the reach of help
Caught in the street, thinkin they can teach they self
When all we wanted was a piece of wealth
And randomly feed our family these streets are insanity
Amber me, caught inside a thugs fantasy
Richest nigga in showbiz is what I plan to be
Heavy desire hold this 9' ready to fire, you know me show me the money like I'm Jerry McGuire, it's on.. Its time we set it straight, connect with Dre the correct way, predicted Platinum in less then a day
So for that we toast, this ones for us why you acting Hov, all I do is write rap, stack, relax and smoke
Watchin my dreams come true, stay humble in the eyes of others, politicing with the wisest brothers
Its Nature, one a the latest, peak how I play this, straight from the Bridge one of your kids favorites
From now till the day that I'm stiff, foul flagrant, pay the rent, always stay swift
Stuck in my ways type chauvinistic, since a youth I had a thing for big hoops, flooded rings and older bitches
Holdin my riches in lump-somes for trust funds, fully recovered thugs lust to bust guns
While some'll get drunk beat wives and cuss sons, a slow process called life lets show progress.. When I said I hold my own I wasn't frontin never claimed to be the baddest for skills, I got a little something
Coming through never the same old, hit a slick verse sippin drinks under a tropic rainbow
Nothin could give me more pleasure to spark this I worked the hardest, ducked the farthest makin me illest producing artist
Done crimes I ran from one time, could catch me with my crew bustin rhymes in the Sunshine
State, no case to fear I been with millionaires, out to make a killin for real's my resolution this year
Few places I walked most imagine, new faces I met at beauty pageants, past cuties now wanna do me
But never forgot where I was from, I check for family and every nigga who was down from day one
If you ain't speakin money language I can't hang with peak, your conversation is weak, I need the heat to get us famous, so it's senseless speak
It’s a game of cat-and-mouse in the Bay
Everybody know where everybody stay
Somebody didn’t make it to the house
Somebody got shot in they mouth
Gotta keep you a thumper, on the tuck, on the under
Can’t be shinin’ too flossy, they’ll turn you into a body
Can’t be stuntin’ too often, they’ll turn your car to a coffin
Have you coughin’ up blood while you was smokin’ your bud
And sippin’ your barre, or should I say lean
Him and his hoe, now it’s a crime scene
I’m a master of reality
Rap about good times and casualties…UH! From the bottom, and I ain’t ever changed
From broke to having my change, mayne
Get up and get it, don’t always place blame
I’ve been blessed by the game This morning, the Lord tapped on my head
Said ‘If it wasn’t for me, you would be dead’
Got up out my bed, got on my knees and thanked Him
I was hecka scared, it was cloudy and rainy
When it come to communication, you gotta be smart
Put your pride to the side and have a heart-to-heart
With your family and folks, your friends and your foes
Life can be short or taller than a stripper pole
I’mma get my shit together, bruh, I promise, I betcha
I’m slappin’ E-40, don’t shoot the messenger
Pack a Mac or a 40 just in case they test ya
Watch out for the Porky, pigs, they arrest ya
Some crooked, corrupted, attitude like ‘fuck it’
Some do they job and care about the public
I’m a master of reality
Rap about good times and casualties…BIATCH! Techniques and tactics, mammoth mathematics
Runnin’ through paper like it’s a laxative
Since I toddler valued a dollar, ya hear me?
I’m the same the dude, I ain’t an impostor, ya feel me?
When you get on your feet, don’t forget your peeps
‘Cause they the ones that hold a nigga down in the streets
When it’s all said and done my testimony ain’t gon’ be phony
Sometimes I lose count on how many people owe me money
Forget about it, hustla, just love ‘em and keep it pushin’
Never know when you gon’ need a brother, we hoodlum
Boss, not a sucker, I love my loved ones, we folks
My bloods and my cousins grew up together, so dope 
When I was a young boy
My father took me into the city
To see a marching band
He said, Son, when you grow up
Would you be the savior of the broken
The beaten and the damned?
He said, Will you defeat them
Your demons, and all the non-believers
The plans that they have made?
Because one day I'll leave you
A phantom to lead you in the summer
To join the black parade. They say they never really miss you til you dead or you gone
So on that note, I'm leaving after the song
So you ain't gotta feel no way about Jay so long
At least let me tell you why I'm this way, hold on
I was conceived by Gloria Carter and Adnes Reeves
Who made love under the sycamore tree, which makes me
A more sicker M.C. and my momma would claim
At 10 pounds, when I was born I didn't give her no pain
Although through the years I gave her her fair share
I gave her her first real scare
I made up for birth when I got here
She knows my purpose wasn't purpose
I ain't perfect, I care
But I feel worthless cause my shirts wasn't matching my gear
Now I'm just scratching the surface cause what's buried under there
Was a kid torn apart once his pop disappeared
I went to school, got good grades, could behave when I wanted
But I had demons deep inside that would raise when confronted He said, Son, when you grow up
Would you be the savior of the broken
The beaten and the damned?
He said, Will you defeat them
Your demons, and all the non-believers
The plans that they have made?
Because one day I'll leave you
A phantom to lead you in the summer
To join the black parade. Now all the teachers couldn't reach me
And my momma couldn't beat me
Hard enough to match the pain of my pops not seeing me, so
With that disdain in my membrane
Got on my pimp game
Fuck the world, my defense came
Then DeHaven introduced me to the game
Spanish Jose introduced me to 'caine
I'm a hustler now
My gear is in and I'm in the in crowd
And all the wavy light-skinned girls is loving me now
My self-esteem went through the roof, man, I got my swag
Got a Volvo from this girl when her man got bagged
Plus I hit my momma with cash from a show that I had
Supposedly, knowing nobody paid Jaz wack ass
I'm getting ahead of myself, by the way, I could rap
But that came second to me moving this crack
Gimme a second, I swear
I will say about my rap career
Til '96 came, niggas I'm here
Good-bye He said, Son, when you grow up
Would you be the savior of the broken
The beaten and the damned?
He said, Will you defeat them
Your demons, and all the non-believers
The plans that they have made?
Because one day I'll leave you
A phantom to lead you in the summer
To join the black parade. Good-bye to the game, all the spoils, the adrenaline rush
Your blood boils you in the spot, knowing cops could rush
And you in a drop, you're so easy to touch
No two days are alike
Except the first and fifteenth, pretty much
And trust is a word you seldom hear from us
Hustlers, we don't sleep, we rest one eye up
And the drought will define a man when the well dries up
You learn the worth of water without work, you thirst til you die, yup!
And niggas get tied up for product
And little brothers' ring fingers get cut up
To show mothers they really got em
And this was the stress I lived with till I decided
To try this rap shit for a living
I pray I'm forgiven
For every bad decision I made
Every sister I played
Cause I'm still paranoid to this day
And it's nobody's fault I made the decisions I made
This is the life I chose, or rather, the life that chose me (If you can't respect that your whole perspective is wack
Maybe you'll love me when I fade to black) When I was a young boy
My father took me into the city
To see a marching band
He said, Son, when you grow up
Would you be the savior of the broken
The beaten and the damned?
He said, Will you defeat them
Your demons, and all the non-believers
The plans that they have made?
Because one day I'll leave you
A phantom to lead you in the summer
To join the black parade.
Who else really trying to mess with Hollywood Cole
I'm with Marley G though
Treating Birmingham just like my Hollywood shows
I'm trying to tell you something that you probably should know
This that Slum Dog Millionaire Bollywood flow and uh
My real friends never hearing from me
Fake friends write the wrong answers on the mirror for me
That's why I pick and choose, I don't get shit confused
I got a small circle, I'm not with different crews
We walk the same path, but got on different shoes
Live in the same building, but we got different views
I got a couple cars, I never get to lose
Don't like my women single, I like my chicks in twos
And these days all the girls are down to roll
We hit the strip club, and all them girls find a pole
I live fast die young, never take it slow
Tell your girl to tell a friend that it's time to go
And tell me today's weather
I know they say they good, but trust me I'm better
I sound like the coldest Miami night ever
I'm cold but still hot you can't decide on a sweater
Really it's whatever
I am murdering and this is so amusing
If they're a sight to see then I am an illusion
I tell you I'm the man baby what is the confusion
And if they still sleeping on me, someone hit the snooze then
And keep sleeping while I sell a couple million
I'm headed for the moon, I ain't bout to hit the ceiling
I'm about to hit the club, women tell me I'm appealing
But fuck what they say let me tell you how I'm feeling
I'm drinking
These London street lamps got a real glow
Dizzy playing driving fast but it feels slow
And ask your man, he a hater, baby, he don't know
I could kick a punt and turn that shit into a field goal
This here was meant to get buried
I got a lot of things, I mention those barely
I ain't lying to the kids like the dentist ain't scary
I'm what Lebron was to Saint Vincent, Saint Marry
But I ain't playing high school games
Pullin McLarence through a McDonalds drive through lane
I'm to fly, I keep it hip hop like Afu-Ra
Baby girl on that Mclaren
You gotta lift the doors
Blades chopping through the city streets, liquid swords
I do it better than the best could
You know what it is, Drake and Tim Westwood
If Macy's don't have it
A hatred addict
I need faces mad with frowns when I'm around
Or I'm wasting fabric
I don't feel great until my plushest pieces
Cause you to suck your teeth
Some mean-mugging on my clean thugging mean nothing
Women dream I'm your husband
I'm Alex Pushkin, the black poetry writing Russian
Ice disgusting. I started bling
How could you question my direction?
I'm king, I'm cultured, not just cause of
The foreign movie posters, the frames
Starring French names, look closer
? to the worm food
I despise and watch fake wise guys who turn stool
And speak highly of late made guys who once ruled
Hard-bottomed shoes, chauffeurs flaunt ambrosia
My baby moms wrote a book that couldn't harm a soldier
Muhammad Ali hobbies, no pilates, jogging, jumping rope
Til my body cut up like a bag of dope
And hope I die ? Worked too hard, stayed up too many nights
If I'm wrong for being me, I don't wanna be right
Nah! No not never, no not ever
I don't wanna be right, hood star, we are Diggi-diggi-dignitaries, Carhart congress
Fitted hat high rank officials
World Bank like Rothschilds
Take the wool from over your eyes
Who conspired to deceive you and I
It's easier for a man to believe a big lie
Than a small truth. Money's not evil
It's the love of money that's the root
Not a luxury car worshipper, but I purchase
Particular vehicles, so me and my dudes, we can cruise
Upsetting policia They study my natural sleepy eye
To see if I'm high. I got my piece of the pie
My 40 acres is my 40 karats on my piece, that's fly
Carti bracelet, you talk that talk and walk that walk
You wouldn't understand our thoughts
How many black leaders are bought
Why the fuck you care if I rap about
How much my sneakers cost? I'mma floss Worked too hard, stayed up too many nights
If I'm wrong for being me, I don't wanna be right
Nah! No not never, no not ever
I don't wanna be right, hood star, we are
You ain't got enough stamps in ya passport
To fuck with Young H-O 
International, uhh
Show young boys how to do this thing
The maturation of Jay-Zeezy, heh
Check me out 30's the new 20 nigga I'm so hot still 
Better broad, better automobile 
Bet a yard  bet a hundred mil
That by the song's end I'll probably start another trend
I know everything you wan' do
I did all that by the age of 21
By 22, I had that brand new Ac' coupe
I guess you could say that my legend just begun
I'm, young enough to know the right car to buy
Yet grown enough not to put rims on it
I got that six-deuce with curtains so you can't see me
And I didn't even have to put tints on it
I don't got the bright watch, I got the right watch
I don't buy out the bar, I bought the nightspot
I got the right stock
I, got, stockbrokers that's movin' it like white tops
I know you're like Fuck! This is child abuse, call DYFS!
I must just be getting nicer
You young boys ain't ready for real
30's the new 20 nigga, I'm so hot still I used to let my pants sag, not givin' a fuck
Baby boy, now I'm all grown up
I used to cruise the used car lot, put chrome on the truck
Baby boy, now I'm all grown up
I used to play the block like that 
I used to carry knots like that 
Now I got black cards, good credit and such
Baby boy cause I'm all grown up, taha! 30's the new 20 nigga, I'm on fire still
These young boys is like fire drills 
False alarms 
He ain't got it 
I'm still here  still here like Mike
Gotta stop playin' with these children 
I'm a bully with the bucks 
Don't let the patent leather shoes fool you youngin'
I got the fully in the tux
That was my past, now I'm so grown up
I don't got one gun on me
Gotta a sum on me to hire a gun army, get ya spun like laundry
And I'll be somewhere under palm trees, calmly listenin' to R&B
When we get the call he's, no longer with us, fire ya babysitters
You little fucks fall back for real
30's the new 20 nigga, I'm so hot still I used to let my pants sag, not givin' a fuck
Baby boy, now I'm all grown up
I used to cruise the used car lot, put chrome on the truck
Baby boy, now I'm all grown up
I used to wear my hoodie like that 
Five deep in a hooptie like that 
Now I got black cards, good credit and such
Baby boy cause I'm all grown up, heheheh Y'all roll blunts, I smoke Cubans all day
Y'all youngins chase, I'm Patronin' it straight

Yeah, all you self-promoters are janky
We established like the Yankees
This whole fuckin' game thankless
We movin' militant but somehow you the one tankin'
No limit to where I can take it
And you know me as a Cris bottle sender, check picker-upper
I thought we looked out for one another
Saw us all as brothers in the struggle, too blessed to be humble
I guess it's different in the city I come from, all the sudden
I got people showing how much they truly resent me
They whole demeanor just spells envy, they tryna tempt me
The higher I get, the less they accept me
Even had the OG's tryna press me, ha-ha-ha, ha
No way out 'cause I'm already in it
I'm not attending when I do a show and get a ticket
Good business can clean millions, I got the vision
I been had it since No Scrubs and No Pigeons
Even back when I wasn't as poppin'
When they told me take an R&B nigga on the road
And I told 'em no and drew for Kendrick and Rocky
I tried to make the right choices with the world watching
Mike never tried to rap like Pac, Pac never tried to sing like Mike
Those my dad's words to me when I asked him how to make it in life
And I always said my mother gave the greatest advice, yeah
Look at me now, they look at me like the golden child
Can't nobody hold me down, especially not right now
Certain shit is just too wild to reconcile
Take that, take that, no love in they heart
So they fake that, DiCaprio level the way they play that
Damn, nigga, what is that?
Y'all don't hear no songs, then hit my phone like you did that
And you even hit my line like, Where you been at?
It's always on some shit like—
When can I get a favor? or Where my bitch at?
Like I'm about to tell you where she been at
Costa Careyes, I got her kidnapped
She ain't sorry and I ain't sorry, it's too late for sorry
Green, White, and Red on my body 'cause I'm dipped in Ferrari
All she wanna do is get high and listen to PARTY
She complain, I tell the driver to drop her at Barneys
My summer diet is just Rosé and calamari
Look, now you got me started
I'm the black sheep, rest in peace to Chris Farley
I got a lot to lose 'cause in every situation I'm the bigger artist Always gotta play it smarter
Y'all shook up, I'm here on the cookup
Cameras pointing every time I look up
That's why I gotta duck behind Chubb's shoulder
Just to hit the Kush up—sponsorship dollars is sky high
He be like, Drake, will you please stop smoking la la?
Chubbs, why try? I'm a thug, I'ma die high
Got the Rose pink tinted lenses, it's a Wednesday
Architects takin' dimensions, they redoin' the entrance
Yeah, redoin' the entrance
Kinda like when you niggas drop on some again and again shit
And you still never quite get it
Meantime, Drizzy over there, tryna make you—
Make you dance to this, yeah, I make you dance to this
I roll big body, wide body, Calabasas road winder
Sunshinin', waxed tires
See Kris Jenner, I beep twice and I wave
The rest of you boys, I blow Keeks right in your face
Pistol by my bed, I'm sleep but I'm awake
For that one night when niggas try and reach inside my safe
Don't push me 'cause I'm way too uneasy nowadays
These guys move so greezy nowadays
I tell you my life and y'all don't believe me when I say it
Save my stories for down the line
I'm too ahead of the curve every time
Just Total the hits and see what you find, you SWV
'Cause you weak and I'm always, always on your mind Yeah, and we can't stop
Make you dance to this
