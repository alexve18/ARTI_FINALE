About (a million)\nHow many niggas bit the soul? 'Bout (a million)\nHow many girls did I bone? About (a million)\nI freestyle battle niggas for (a million)\nHey yo, y'all niggas don't want it\nIt's (a million) ways to die in this city\nHear me? (a million) Look, listen\n\nA lot of speculation about the money I've made, me and Just Blaze\nHow are they fo'real, are them niggas really paid?\nRappers I've met or dealt with direct\nIs it true he won't send a beat tape until he get a check?\nWhat's the position you hold?\nCan he really master depths who check by check\nAnd 'H to the IZZO' only single that went gold?\nIf Roc-a-Fella should fold and you're left out in the cold\nIs it back to ghost producin' for D.Dot on the low?\nFor the millionth time, askin' me\nQuestions like Toni Braxton, harassin' me\nLike you don't care about my son's feelin's\nCan I get a minute, you whack [bitch]\nI ain't gotta jack shit\nYou heard 'Takeover', who runnin' this rap shit?\nEww fake tits\nShut up and make hits\nCan't we all just get along, spread love like Take Six\nWhat'chu doin' in L.A. with 50 Cent and Dr. Dre?\nDidn't one them niggas have beef with Jay?\nWe doin' this shit for entertainment\nBrings guns to the arraignment\nWhile the judge in the chamber let one up out the chamber\nBLAOW! {*laughs*}\n\nI'm gonna sell (a million)\nAnd after that I'ma buy a couple buildin's\nMy dog He Nice named his son (a million)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/3a5e35c68e9ed7bf9a2a63bfa51b261e.675x675x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kanye West"}
