(Woo!)\nWe off in Vegas drinking and partying\nWe got chicks in swimsuits modeling\nWe in the twin stretch Maybachs dipping low\nThe way the wrist shine it's so magical\nYou know them boys got the clubs out of control (Ho!)\nNigga what ya heard, it's Kells and Hov\nWith the second coming of Best Of Both\nIn the first week I predict a million sold, we talking...\n\n[Verse 1: Jay-Z] (R. Kelly)\nBig chips! Big trips to Vegas nigga\nBig cribs and the whips is spacious (Uh huh)\nAny day they could dig your grave\nShit, so big is my inspiration, dig?\nNo reward unless the risk is taken\nIn which case you niggas wouldn't wanna switch places\nI, on the other hand, relish the situation\nThank the Lord for the gift, I'm gracious\nI went overboard, look at this big bracelet\nI overhauled it, you wouldn't recognize it\nFrom the time that I bought it I just replaced it\nI risk cases for shit like this, nigga I pray for some shit like this\nWord to my Uncle Ray, who gave his life for some shit like this\nMa, you rolling? I'm as real as it gets\n\n[Hook: R. Kelly]\n\n[Verse 2: R. Kelly]\nBig chips! I can't take this\nThe way you move your ass slow like Matrix\nYou make me wanna toss chips in Vegas\nBefore I toss chips, first, get naked\nI can't fake it, girl you got the club shut down when you freak it\nSuperstar honey, so mean and vicious\nGot a lot in common, I'm so mean and vicious\nBark bark farmer, this chicken laying platinum ex-farmer (preach!)\nSo go low mama, give it a go\nAs I punch 170 on stretch roads\nMust turn up the radio\nGirl you so good I'm swerving like 'Whoa, whoa!'\nUh oh! Uh uh oh! From the club to the stretch\nOut the stretch to the hotel, into the hotel suite!\n\n[Hook: R. Kelly]\n\n[Verse 3: Jay-Z]\nBig chips! I'm a boss I said\nTilt my hat and I cross my legs\nLike old ladies at the park, I toss my bread\nAnd the pigeons start flocking, ballin' like Bishop Loughlin\nAnd stick Cochran on any DA why try to stop him\nSo any gunplay, that is an option\nI been doing this since niggas was wopping\nRockin Izods with the matching socks, and\nSlap boxing in the back park and when the girls start watching\nTo try to get real, you had to drop 'em\nSee I ain't never been a fronter\nOr fake it till I make it type nigga\nMa I don't want ya number\nEither you're coming or aIone ya\nEither you know what you want ma, or I don't even want ya\nYou play pretty if you wanna\n\n[Hook: R. Kelly]\n\n[Bridge: R. Kelly]\nAll around the world, stop where the sun sets\nSpending big chips you wanna go (Uh oh, uh uh oh!)\nYou wanna go (Uh oh, uh uh oh!)\nSay we going around the world, stop where the sun sets\nSpending big chips you wanna go (Uh oh, uh uh oh!)\nDo you wanna go (Uh oh, uh uh oh!)\n\n[Outro: R. Kelly]\nUh, come on, Tone, I see ya, Jigga, Kells, uh, yeah, Track Masters\nWhat's really good, we in the islands chillin in the shade and shit you know\nBlue waters, yellow sand, uh\nEither I'm high or, I think I just saw a dolphin", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8893522e324b548e44146de3167af81c.640x640x1.jpg"}], "artist": "JAY-Z"}
