Enlighten me\nIs you gon' live on your knees or die on your feet?\nS'Fire in the street, fire in my Swisher\nFire in between the two legs of your little sister\nJust get a sip of this elixir, before they crop us out of the picture\nI've never seen a crop circle but I've seen cops circle the block\nI puff squares, but I swear one day I'ma stop, my nerves itch\nOn the brink of my career while my peers struggle for employment\nCan you hear these screams?\n(Uncle Sam ain't no kin to me) One, two\nThree four grams and a fifth of Hennessey\nA bad bitch, fuck the penitentiary\nSection 80's babies, blame Ronald Reagan, we raising hell\nLord forbid, the homie got wet, so we trying to soak it in\nThe president is black, but you can't vote for skin\nYou vote for the better man\nCome to our show, you can see the diversity\nUnify the people, they gon' peep it universally\nWe might not change the world\nBut we gon' manipulate it, I hope you participatin'\nAyo Dot, won't you let these cats know?\nWe knew we'd be here, like back in 04'\nStarted HiiiPower because our generation needed a generator\nIn a system meant to disintegrate us\nAnd all we do is assist them\nWe're not victors, we're victims\nThe bigger picture isn't developed yet\nLike what if Keisha was celibate?\nOr what if Tammy came across a real man\nWho didn't play games like children?\nMy nigga cheated on his girlfriend\nWith his girlfriend's girlfriend, let the world end\nAnd everybody tripping off 2012\nAnd the extraterrestrial presence as well\n(Odd Future's aight) But our future is not\nThat Martial law shit dropped, we gon' all get got\nSo keep that question mark on your face\nEat your fast food, use your fluoride toothpaste\nHide your feelings from the public\nWork a little nine to five, don't forget to pay your tithes\nAnd to thank God you're alive\nHiiiPower\nAnd on another note\nWe focused like the Hubble Telescope\nSoul!\n\n[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Alori Joh]\nLife is a traffic jam, life is a traffic jam\nLife is a traffic jam, life is a traffic jam\nLife is a traffic jam, life is a traffic jam\nLife is a traffic jam, life is a traffic jam\nLife is a traffic jam\n\n[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar & Ab-Soul]\nI wrote this because I was ordered to\nPeople say I speak for generation Y\nWhy lie, I do, Section 80\nYour son will play me if the radio won't\nDaughters that just turn one to twenty one listen to Kendrick\nFor instance\nWhat's your life about?
