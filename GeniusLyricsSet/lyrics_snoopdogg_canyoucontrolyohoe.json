(You got a bitch that won't do what you say)\nYou can't control your hoe? (She hardheaded, she just won't obey)\nCan you control your hoe? (You've got to know what to do, and what to say)\nYou've got to put that bitch in her place, even if it's slapping her in her face\nYa got to control your hoe. Can you control your hoe?\n\nI went to your house; your girl came in and started cussing you out. You should have slapped her\nIn her face, I wanted to tell you, but it wasn't my place. I kept it on the low, cause I know you\nWas gonna check that hoe. But instead, you was quiet as a mouse, maybe you started to think it\nWasn't your house. Cause she was acting like a nut, you got a kind of bitch that would kick your\nButt. What kind of pimp holds back? Never met a bitch that a pimp can't slap, whats wrong with\nThe pimpin'? Why you get a whippin'? All I got to say is this:\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Verse: 2]\nThis is what you made me do; I really didn't want to put hands on you. But bitch you playin'\nWith fire, i'm so sick and tired, of loud mouth bitches like you, a nigga had to go and put tips\nOn you, cause bitch you playin' with fire, i'm so sick and tired\n\nThis is what you forced me to do, I really didn't want to put hands on you, but bitch you\nPlayin' with fire, i'm so sick and tired. Of bitches like you, a nigga had to go and put tips on\nYou, bitch you playin' with fire, I'm so sick and tired\n\n[Chorus]\n(No: can you control your hoe? At the end.)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8c99dd335733f9c3cf16f57c9f589cfb.361x361x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Snoop Dogg"}
