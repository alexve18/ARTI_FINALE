I ain't felt this (good since!)\nScrooge McDuck, (here we go!) Elementary hood shit\n\n[Bridge]\nNow I was raised in a sandbox, next to you and her\nYou was holding the handgun, she was giving birth\nTo a baby boy to be just like you, I wonder what's that worth\nI-I wonder if you ever knew that you was a role model to me first\nThe next day I-I woke up in the morning, seen you on the news\nLooked in the mirror, then realized that I-I-I had something to prove\nYou told me \"Don't be like me, just finish watching cartoons\"\nWhich is funny now cause all I see is Wile E.
