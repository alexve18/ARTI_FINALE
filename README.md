# ARTI_FINALE
This will be our final project in Arti course making a rap lyrics generator using a hidden Markov model

https://github.com/johnwmillr/LyricsGenius We used this code to scrape rap lyrics from Genius website which we then created a python script to go through those files and trim what wasn't needed and combined them into a single file which our hidden Markov model went through each word learning the probabilities of the next word searching three words at a time.
